      "Some react fine to vaccines, others are paralysed or killed.\n",
      "Well, we've asked them to accelerate whatever they're doing, in terms of a vaccine, absolutely,\n",
      "It is not a race between vaccine producers, it is a race against this particular virus,\n",
      "I am only hopeful that when we start studying some of these new vaccines, pregnant women are included, not as part of phase 4 but earlier.\n",
      "I think we all have never wanted science to work so quickly. But until there's either a vaccine, some sort of pharmaceutical intervention, or herd immunity, the science is the science.\n",
      "This study is really important because it says that if you implement screening and vaccination programs right now in 2020, that improvements in screening coverage would have a bigger impact on prevention of invasive cancer and associated death,\n",
      "Thousands fewer women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer as a result of improved screening services and the HPV vaccine and it's incredible to think that cervical cancer could be eradicated for good.\n",
      "We'll have a drug fairly soon but the vaccine will take longer. When SARS happened it took 20 months to have a vaccine into humans,\n",
      "We've got six children and we don't vaccinate, we don't do vaccinations on all of our children. So we definitely pick and choose which ones we're going to do. It's got to be up to the parents, we can never mandate that.\n",
      "Because there is no vaccine, cure, or effective treatment for COVID-19, the only known way to protect against serious illness or death caused by the novel coronavirus is social distancing coupled with strict hygiene, both of which are virtually impossible in a detention setting. For those reasons, correctional public health experts recommend the immediate release of those who are vulnerable to suffering the most acutely from COVID-19, as well as drastic reductions in the number of people detained.\n",
      "First there is the need to manufacture the vaccine for clinical studies under tightly controlled conditions, certified and qualified -- we need ethical approval and regulatory approval. Then the clinical trial can start with 500 people in phase 1. This is always in healthy adults aged about 18 to 55, and usually the primary read-out from a phase 1 study is safety,\n",
      "Investigators are working on vaccines, on antiviral therapies, on diagnostic strategies, and on how we can inactivate the virus on surfaces. We're trying to tackle this problem from every angle we can.\n",
      "It will also assist in the assessment of [ the ] effectiveness of trial vaccines.\n",
      "We are focused on meeting the [ National Institutes of Health's ] timeline for delivery of the vaccine for use in the phase 1 human clinical trials.\n",
      "Beyond the public health impacts, it's also important to think about the cost of our low vaccination rates,\n",
      "From my perspective today, I do not see how we are going to have large gatherings of people again until we have a vaccine, which is months and months away,\n",
      "These comments are extremely unhelpful. It may well be a new vaccine that halts COVID-19 and saves millions of lives around the world. Vaccines are one of the great success stories of modern medicine but the rise of the anti-vaxxer trend has led to unfounded doubts about the safety of vaccinations.\n",
      "This decisive action and financial support from the UK Government comes at a pivotal moment for a world that is in crisis. The UK has a long history of global health leadership and, today, the UK is once again stepping up as a global leader in its support CEPI and our crucial work to accelerate the development of a vaccine against COVID-19,\n",
      "We are commencing a study in the near future, initially planned for about 1,000 healthcare workers, but with plans to rapidly expand to multiple sites as the demand increases. We will vaccinate healthcare workers at highest risk first, such as those who work in emergency centers, ICUs and watch for how protective the vaccine proves. Clearly the data will be monitored and will be done under the auspices of regulatory bodies including the FDA.\n",
      "We could have these waves of flare ups, controls, flare ups and controls until we actually get a therapy or a vaccine,\n",
      "One of the many steps we should take is to expedite the process requiring insurers to cover the cost of a COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available. This coverage could help more folks access treatment and offer some economic relief to families. I'm glad to help introduce this bipartisan effort and will work to move it forward.\n",
      "Ultimately what we really need to focus on is generating the clinical data that shows that the vaccine, in fact, does have a benefit, that it's safe and effective,\n",
      "It's devastating to think about how many children do not have reliable access to health care. This means they are deprived of vaccinations and treatment for infectious diseases, which are common in displacement camps.\n",
      "Really good contact tracing can be as effective as a vaccine.\n",
      "The oral vaccine -- the attenuated live vaccine -- can knock it out of circulation completely because it creates immunity in the gut and stops the virus spreading. That's why the first countries to use it could eradicate polio early on,\n",
      "We never called the 2016 measles outbreak `The Southern California unvaccinated virus,' that wouldn't have been appropriate,\n",
      "Well folks, shes done it. Dont get me wrong, she has more trials to do to assure its efficacy-but my 5 yr old just came into my bedroom with a vial full of colored water and told me' i just made the vaccine for coronavirus! '\n",
      "This type of intensive intervention package... will need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more).\n",
      "We need a vaccine but people should not bring up their hopes,\n",
      "Even if intravenous vitamin C works to shorten or cure COVID-19, it will likely only be a stop-gap before therapies directed at the virus, such as vaccinations, take over.\n",
      "It is perfectly understandable given the evolving situation sans a vaccine. Reassurance with regard to health infrastructure in addition to preventive measures would have been helpful,\n",
      "Parents must make sure that their children and teenagers are protected against mumps by ensuring they have been immunised with two doses of MMR. A third dose of MMR won't cause any harm so anyone unsure of whether they have had two doses or not, can safely receive the vaccine again,\n",
      "until we're all vaccinated,\n",
      "We are proud to be able to help support the vital work of the WHO and CEPI as they work towards finding a vaccine for Covid-19.\n",
      "Yes exactly. If it is going to be something seasonal. It can be something offered by the doctor and it probably will be more effective than seasonal flu, because flu virus changes every year. But for this virus, it is possible you can make the vaccine and put it on the shelf and use it for the following years.\n",
      "Finding a safe and effective vaccine... is an urgent public health priority,\n",
      "The only exit strategy is a vaccine,\n",
      "Allowing pharmacists to vaccinate makes it more convenient for families, providing greater access to the influenza vaccine and improving rates of immunisation,\n",
      "CDC led an aggressive response, in cooperation with state and local health departments. We took this troubling development as an opportunity to go on offense, launching an unprecedented media campaign of HHS leaders promoting the importance of vaccination.\n",
      "In terms of what that reality (of managing COVID-19 without a vaccine) means about the border, we just can't say today,\n",
      "That advice is for everyone but it is especially vital if you are over 70, eligible for the flu vaccine or pregnant. At all times, follow the advice on washing your hands, using tissues and touching your face.\n",
      "carry out additional pre-clinical vaccine testing, perform safety and toxicology studies, assist with manufacturing of the vaccine, and conduct clinical trials with rVSV-ZEBOV.\n",
      "Herd immunity only works if you have a vaccine and 85 to 90 percent of the population is inoculated,\n",
      "It's communities that will do this. There's no magic bullet (for Covid-19), there's no magic vaccine or therapy, it's just behaviors,\n",
      "Only 65% of people indicating that they would accept a vaccine for themselves and their children,\n",
      "that's only because there's a flu vaccine\n",
      "following a well-publicized March 2, 2020 meeting with President Trump to discuss the COVID-19 outbreak, Defendant Kim again claimed that Inovio had developed a COVID-19 vaccine, stating `we were able to fully construct our vaccine within three hours... Our plan is to start [ U.S. based COVID-19 trials ] in April of this year. '\n",
      "Until we get almost everybody vaccinated globally we still won't be fully back to normal.\n",
      "And, to our knowledge, these nucleic acid vaccines have not yet been tested in elderly patients either.\n",
      "I know that's dreadful news to hear. How are people supposed to find work if this goes on in some form for a year and a half? Is all that economic pain worth trying to stop COVID-19? The truth is we have no choice. We cannot return to normal until there's a vaccine. Conferences, concerts, sporting events, religious services, dinner in a restaurant, none of that will resume until we find a vaccine, a treatment, or a cure.\n",
      "It's not something that we can prevent from happening in the absence of a vaccine. It's not containable in the way that those viruses were,\n",
      "You take a solid flu vaccine, you don't think that would have an impact-or much of an impact - on corona?\n",
      "Based on this information, the Sheriff's Office strongly encourages former patients of Dr. Koinis to contact their healthcare provider about testing for vaccinations,\n",
      "So far WHO has received applications for review and approval of 40 diagnostic tests, 20 vaccines are in development and many clinical trials of therapeutics are underway,\n",
      "vaccines are coming along very quickly\n",
      "there are no vaccines available for any coronaviruses let alone the (Wuhan) one,\n",
      "It's not like there is something like a vaccine or Theraflu to make us feel better about this.\n",
      "Let us not forget to bring our children to the new round of immunization so they can be given oral polio vaccine,\n",
      "falsely promising to consumers that Silver Solution can cure, eliminate, kill or deactivate coronavirus and/or boost elderly consumers' immune systems when there is, in fact, no vaccine, potion, pill, potion or other product available to treat or cure coronavirus disease 2019.\n",
      "I watched one of the most inspirational and bravest people that I ever encountered, the late Laura Brennan from Ennis, spend the last moments of her life campaigning to raise awareness around the critical importance of the HPV vaccine,\n",
      "Ignore offers for a COVID-19 vaccine, cure, or treatment,\n",
      "Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we lower that [ the population ] by perhaps 10 or 15 percent,\n",
      "Once the weight of disease in wildlife has been addressed, we will accelerate other elements of our strategy including improved diagnostics and cattle vaccination to sustain the downward trajectory of the disease.\n",
      "Trials may have overestimated efficacy by combining high-grade cervical disease with low-grade cervical changes that occur more frequently but often resolve spontaneously without progressing. We found insufficient data to clearly conclude that HPV vaccine prevents the higher-grade abnormal cell changes that can eventually develop into cervical cancer.\n",
      "My takeaway is that vaccine skeptics probably don't have the best understanding of how likely or probable different events are,\n",
      "The direction I've given our officials is that if we see a highly credible regulator of medications in a peer jurisdiction like the European Union, Australia or the United States that has approved a test or a vaccine or medication, we should pursue that. We should not wait for Health Canada to catch up,\n",
      "This technology of engineering recombinant influenza viruses has enabled the generation of more effective flu vaccines that are highly compatible with current vaccine platforms and confer effective protection against seasonal viruses as well as cross protection against drifted pandemic viruses,\n",
      "We asked them to accelerate whatever they're doing in terms of the vaccine, absolutely,\n",
      "As PH (1-110) could be paired with any protein, our technology opens up the possibility of reducing the cost of conservation and distribution of vaccines by about 80% -- the cost of the temperature-controlled supply chain.\n",
      "In 2015, some people tried really actively to get them to take down the (anti-vaccination) stuff and it did not resonate with them,\n",
      "This is now the fifth year of finding less than 2% of young sexually active women infected with HPV16 or 18. These new data demonstrate the huge impact of the vaccination programme in its first 10 years.\n",
      "We are pleased to see the rapid advancement of their vaccine candidate into clinical safety testing. Producing a COVID-19 vaccine within the next 12 to 18 months is not only a scientific challenge; it will also require new levels of collaboration and investment across industry and government. There is still a long road ahead before we have a safe, effective, and globally accessible vaccine ready for broader use, but today we have reached an important milestone on that journey.\n",
      "While the development of a pregnancy-specific malaria vaccine is underway, the devastating burden of malaria in pregnancy reminds us of the importance of developing and utilising a suite of interventions to prevent and treat malaria in pregnancy,\n",
      "who can model all facets of this disease, including spread, drug repurposing, and the development of new vaccines.\n",
      "Messenger RNA can encode the viral antigens, but in order to work, we need to find a way to deliver these antigens to the correct part of the body so that they get expressed and generate an immune response. We also need to make sure that the vaccine causes appropriate immune stimulation to get a strong response,\n",
      "The £ 20 million announced today will help our globally recognised vaccine development capabilities continue to develop new defences against emerging diseases, including coronavirus.\n",
      "They want to test the new vaccine first in Africa.\n",
      "We see there is no vaccine that can prevent it,\n",
      "were so determined to show that everything was under control that they sent the wrong signals about the adequacy of supplies of the vaccine.\n",
      "Flu can lead to further serious illnesses including bronchitis and pneumonia, so if your child was aged two or three on 31 st August 201,9 and they haven't had their vaccine yet speak to your GP today as it's not too late to get them protected.\n",
      "I challenge our researchers, and especially our university professors and research doctors to come up with a cure or vaccine for coronavirus,\n",
      "the 1918 influenza pandemic was the most severe pandemic in recent history. It was caused by an H1N1 virus with genes of avian origin. Although there is not universal consensus regarding where the virus originated, it spread worldwide during 1918-1919. In the United States, it was first identified in military personnel in spring 1918. It is estimated that about 500 million people or one-third of the world's population became infected with this virus. The number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide with about 675,000 occurring in the United States. Mortality was high in people younger than 5 years old, 20-40 years old, and 65 years and older. The high mortality in healthy people, including those in the 20-40 year age group, was a unique feature of this pandemic. While the 1918 H1N1 virus has been synthesized and evaluated, the properties that made it so devastating are not well understood. With no vaccine to protect against influenza infection and no antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections that can be associated with influenza infections, control efforts worldwide were limited to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as isolation, quarantine, good personal hygiene, use of disinfectants, and limitations of public gatherings, which were applied unevenly.\n",
      "There's no magic vaccine or therapy, it's just behaviors -- each of our behaviors translating into something that changes the course of this viral pandemic over the next 30 days.\n",
      "Through our partnership with Moderna and the NIH, we hope to speed the development of a vaccine against the coronavirus and help to alleviate the burden of disease,\n",
      "But that way, if I have to prove that I was vaccinated for hepatitis B when I go to nursing school or medical school many years later, I go online, put on my record in, and boom -- they can see that I've been vaccinated.\n",
      "The technology has been designed as a platform approach to generate vaccines against a range of human and animal viruses and has shown promising results in the laboratory targeting viruses such as influenza, Ebola, Nipah and MERS coronavirus,\n",
      "But today, our universities face extraordinary challenges. In Atlanta and Austin, as well as across the country, courageous health professionals and brilliant scientists are caring for the stricken and searching for a vaccine, while our faculty are educating students at a distance. I stand with them, and we must continue with the immediate job at hand. Accordingly, for the next few months, I will devote my time and energy to leading UT Austin through this crisis. My wife, Carmel, and I look forward to the day when we can begin the next phase of our lives at Emory.\n",
      "This package will provide necessary resources to combat the spread of coronavirus. It will help develop a vaccine, support state and local governments, and assist our community health centers. I am so proud of the Nebraskans who are responding to this crisis through the great work at UNMC, Nebraska Medicine, and Camp Ashland.\n",
      "We have to make sure that the vaccine is very low priced and that there's a fund for buying it for everyone, whether you're in a low, middle, or a high income country,\n",
      "With the Serum Institute's financial and technical support, we will be able to push a coronavirus vaccine into the clinic on an extremely rapid timeline... We are proud to be confronting this public health crisis head-on.\n",
      "It's very early in the development of a vaccine\n",
      "The goal is to keep the government from forcing parents into a situation where they are vaccinating. It's not an anti- or pro-vax bill. It allows people to decide for themselves.\n",
      "Women have intrinsically different immune responses to men. Women are more likely to suffer from auto-immune diseases, and there is good evidence that women produce better antibodies to vaccines against flu.\n",
      "based on other things that we have done with this type of vaccine.\n",
      "Our goal is to have these vaccines developed very rapidly and to move very rapidly to begin clinical trials,\n",
      "Placing blame doesn't help. Strengthening the UN, in particular the underfunded WHO, is a better investment, for example to develop and distribute tests and vaccines.\n",
      "I'm curious Kail, when a vaccine for this virus is made will you or the kids get one?\n",
      "Whatever struggles we had fighting vaccine mandates prior to COVID-19, those struggles are now amplified by a factor of 100,\n",
      "First, we can use such artificially primed B-cells as living therapeutics that can provide the useful antibodies for an extended period within the patient's body. Second, using the artificial lymph node, we can discover various antibody molecules that can recognize various pathogens or even our own cancers. Third, we can develop safer and cheaper vaccines. Lastly, the artificial system can be used as a critical research tool for studying the physiology of immune-cell related cancers such as lymphomas and leukemias.\n",
      "We've had people of color being hit with this more than anybody else because people are living in poverty and don't have health care and we need to make sure that we're equitable when it comes to whatever the solution is to this in a vaccine. It needs to get to everybody, not just the elite,\n",
      "As the Wall Street Journal pointed out, the kind of innovation for treatments and vaccines that we need to battle the Coronavirus, that all comes from the private industry,\n",
      "Pharmaceutical companies have already formed a consortium to work together to share information about the development of therapeutics and vaccines.\n",
      "We know that even if somebody has already been exposed, already infected, if we vaccinate them, the course of disease is far less severe [ and ]... the survival rate is very, very high,\n",
      "There is no clear path, unlike pandemic influenza, where the strategy was to control and contain until the vaccine came because we knew the vaccine would come,\n",
      "So we can't do anything that is normally routine. We'll do puppy and kitten vaccines because that is considered to be something where they could get sick, but otherwise we can't do routine things at all,\n",
      "the scale required to vaccinate many millions of people\n",
      "Until there is a vaccine or an adequate cure that reduces the morbidity rates.\n",
      "This is not nonsense, be aware, do not take it lightly, there are dead, many lives at stake and we still do not know how far this will go, so the time has come to get vaccinated for responsibility for the common good. It is a time of solitude and generosity! To stay home and protect others.\n",
      "We don't have a vaccine for this one, and we probably won't for at least a year,\n",
      "The UK Government has pledged an additional £ 210 million of support to accelerate work to find a coronavirus vaccine, in an announcement following a virtual summit of G20 leaders. The funding will ensure British scientists and researchers continue to lead the global fight against the virus. The UK has now pledged £ 544 million in total which makes it the biggest contributor to Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) -- the international coalition to find a vaccine.\n",
      "It is important that many different approaches to developing a vaccine proceed in parallel. We simply do not have the luxury to wait on the results of one vaccine trial to see if we need to adopt a different strategy,\n",
      "It's an opportunity to get new treatments, new vaccines. And all of this needs time. Now, we are unlikely to get a treatment or a vaccine within the next few months -- those things take years. And in our case we hope that maybe we'll get it in a year or maybe 18 months.\n",
      "It's repurposing a very old vaccine for a new purpose,\n",
      "Now, do I believe that's going to happen? I think that's highly dependent on whether they come up with some type of vaccine, how long does this go on for and whether people start going back to work once this peaks.\n",
      "But we're planning to start trials in the next few months and, if we're successful, subject to regulatory considerations, we aim to complete the development required to make the vaccine available in the second half of 2021.\n",
      "I was immunocompromised from aged 12 to 16. Being in an environment with unvaccinated kids would have put my life at risk,\n",

Now that seems foolish. What I'm saying is on the other side of that, it's not just hopeful optimism and belief in the power of people to figure things out. It's saying, let's wait and see. We have some time. We have the best minds in the world working on (a cure). It's not just a vaccine, it's treatment options, how will the virus react at different times of the year, things that we don't know.\n",
      "I don't think ultimate resolution comes until there's a vaccine... that's 18 months,\n",
      "The priority is to get vaccines and therapeutics. Price controls won't get us there.\n",
      "We will be lucky to get a vaccine within a year,\n",
      "It's not like flu. It's not like any other viruses and diseases where we have vaccination... everyone is susceptible to this virus in Australia,\n",
      "Science plays an important role in the fight against ASF. Supporting VIDO-InterVac's vaccine research is a key step forward in stopping the progress of this deadly disease,\n",
      "We're waiting for a specific vaccine but this is something that that may be of use to the broader population.\n",
      "But for the first time we've got to think seriously that we've only got a two-to-three-month window (to decide) if we can continue with the games.... If the situation doesn't improve, or vaccines aren't available, and it continues to escalate then the only possibility is that the Games will be canceled.\n",
      "often combined with anti-vaccination narratives\n",
      "We're going to be in this for the duration until there's a vaccine, right, so let's start thinking about protective equipment that works for everybody,\n",
      "In creating that arbitrary binary divide, Defendant Schiff ignores all the valid medical, economic, and legal points in AAPS's speech on vaccines,\n",
      "This situation will definitely affect international mobility, be it internal or external. Till vaccines are in place and this virus is controlled once and for all, people won't want to take risks. The word `global' won't be in their dictionaries for the next 12-18 months at least,\n",
      "But all the methods that we're using today to track the course of this pandemic are genetic techniques. When we make new generation vaccines against this virus, we'll be using the same techniques that the scientists in the show discovered to create recombinant DNA. We would be helpless against this pandemic, had it not been for the hundred years of genetics that preceded it.\n",
      "It was known for a long time, that pandemics are very likely to happen and it was very well understood, that there was likely to be a coronavirus pandemic with slight modifications of the SARS epidemic. They could have worked on vaccines, on developing protection for potential coronavirus pandemics, and with minor modifications we could have vaccines available today.\n",
      "It's extremely damaging when celebrities like Pete Evans come out and align themselves with prominent vaccine deniers like Robert Kennedy, whose organisation is very strongly anti-vaccination,\n",
      "Our aim is to identify an exit strategy from culling in those areas that have completed the four years of intensive culling by deploying vaccination to the remaining badger population,\n",
      "The government is very keen that a vaccine against the novel coronavirus is developed in Germany and in Europe,\n",
      "The UK is a hub of world-leading and pioneering research, and it is vital that we lead the way in developing new vaccines to target global threats with scientists from across the world,\n",
      "Until there's either a vaccine, some sort of pharmaceutical intervention, or herd immunity, the science is the science,\n",
      "It's over when people know I'm 100 percent safe, and I don't have to worry about this. When does that happen? When we have a vaccine,\n",
      "needs the facility to rapidly develop and produce vaccines.\n",
      "We have no treatments, no vaccine, and no immunity, so this is as much going to be a society response... as it is going to be a medical response.\n",
      "When parents take their babies for their two-month check-ups, the rotavirus vaccine is now among the vaccinations they will be offered through the publicly funded immunization program,\n",
      "We may not be back to normal by November because a vaccine might not be available,\n",
      "We're going to starve it. We we're going to bomb it. And we're going to kill it. The way you starve it is you stop human-to-human transmission. social distancing will starve the virus. The way you bomb it is drug therapies that you were talking about, we're going to bomb the hell out of it. We're going to take it from a 10 to hopefully to a 1 or 2 and eventually we're going to kill it with a vaccine,\n",
      "Why won't #DoctorsSpeakUp that vaccines harm many of their patients?\n",
      "He would go to the countryside to write. His vaccine was poetry,\n",
      "committed to bringing an affordable vaccine to the public on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use.\n",
      "Not everybody is going to get deathly sick. I mean, there are therapeutics. There are therapies that will treat this. A vaccine is a year away.\n",
      "Our supercomputer centres stand ready to help researchers in their work to develop new treatment and vaccines,\n",
      "This will enable CEPI to expand the number of vaccine candidates to increase the chances of success, and to fund the clinical trials for these candidate vaccines. So far, CEPI have initiated 6 partnerships to improve our understanding of and to develop vaccines against the novel coronavirus,\n",
      "It'll be semi-normal until that vaccine is out there in billions of doses,\n",
      "It's a new virus. As a species, we have no immunity built up to it whatsoever. Even more important than that, unlike the flu, there's no vaccine, there's no treatment for it yet. That's why it's really taking over the headlines right now.\n",
      "Our mission is to reduce the global burden of infectious disease by developing the highest-quality reagents in rapid response to emerging public health threats. The release of these Coronavirus antigens within one month of the newly identified 2019-nCoV genome being published exemplifies the power of The Native Antigen Company's recombinant protein platforms to prepare reagents in response to new threats. As one of the first recognised suppliers to release 2019-nCoV proteins, we are proud to be able to offer these antigens to in vitro diagnostics and pharmaceutical researchers to help drive the development of serological assays and vaccines that will be vital in stemming the spread of this disease.\n",
      "Dr. Ngozi on behalf of Gavi has vaccinated 86% of the world's children and has saved over 13 million lives since 2000. She is truly doing God's work. Dr. Ngozi is an economist, international development expert and the Chair of @gavialliance - an incredible organization that has helped immunize more than 760 million children and saved 13 million lives. The proof is in the numbers, and it's evident that with organizations like Gavi and its amazing partners like @unicef and @who, we can eradicate extreme poverty. ðÂ  ¤ Â  #Davos 2020\n"
