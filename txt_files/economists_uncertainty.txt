14 14 I do not know whether he did or not but he was saying that he had either rung or was ringing the Minister ( Shane Ross ) to inform him of the same.
15 15 I 'm not going into details of exactly what they said as it 's very delicate at the moment but you can take it that everybody sees they will have skin in the game here and everybody is united in ensuring there will be a solution that is shared.
16 16 In that period, Krishna Menon played an important role in convincing Nehru that Partition was inevitable ... V.P. Menon sold the idea of Partition to Patel. Both Menons had come round to the view that the Muslim League and the Congress could not work together,.
18 18 We have to be bold and aggressive against all forms of communalism. Unfortunately in the public, the propaganda is that the Congress is soft on minority communalism. It is a reality. We have to address this issue. We can not live in a make-believe world. We should wake up,.
21 21 response to the whole range of Russian missile systems -- conventional and nuclear -- currently deployed or under development.
25 25 agreed that NATO could contribute more to regional stability and the fight against international terrorism.

39 39 They were warning us of our end and said recite kalma if you wish to.
42 42 The Bank of Canada is taking concerted action to support the Canadian economy during this period of economic stress. The Bank 's Governing Council stands ready to do what is required to support economic growth and keep inflation on target, and we will continue to ensure that the Canadian financial system has sufficient liquidity and credit markets can continue to function well.
43 43 we ca n't possibly sit down and figure out how to have free trade within Canada.
47 47 Given the fast pace of change, driven by the 4th industrial revolution-from artificial intelligence to robotics, machine learning, quantum computing-Africa must invest more in re-directing and re-skilling its labor force, and especially the youth, to effectively participate,.
48 48 Africa does not need anyone to believe in her or to affirm her place and position in history. Africa will and must develop with pride. For right on the inside of us, as Africans, lies our greatest instrument of successes : confidence !.
50 50 Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. As such, it can no longer be business as usual.
51 51 if we are convinced that there is a seriousness in the approach the government is taking,.
55 55 If tomorrow, we woke up in a world with 100 percent gender equality, the wealth of the world would be $ 172 trillion bigger. We would be a much richer world. If we are to bring the Middle East on par with the more advanced economies over the next years, there would be $ 1 trillion more in output,.
56 56 First, the global economic outlook for 2020 is expected to be negative. We will face recession at least as bad as during the global financial crisis or worse, but we expect the recovery in 2021. Countries should undertake more bold fiscal actions,.
58 58 We are still hoping that the most likely scenario would be relatively rapid containment of the virus.
59 59 It is too early to say because we do n't yet quite know what is the nature of this virus. We do n't know how quickly China will be able to contain it. We do n't know whether it will spread to the rest of the world. If the disease is contained rapidly, there can be a sharp drop and a very rapid rebound, in what is known as the V-shaped impact,.
61 61 For low-income countries, we have rapid-disbursing emergency financing of up to $ 10 billion ( 50 percent of quota of eligible members ) that can be accessed without a full-fledged IMF programme.
65 65 revenue to the regime that it may use to fund terror and other destabilizing activities.
66 66 Tackling trade is only a start. The global economy will continue to encounter major shocks if we fail to address another urgent global challenge : climate change,.
69 69 the current guessing game for economists, including the treasury, is how high will unemployment be before we can be confident that there is a peak.
73 73 Some outsiders came and tortured the students of the ( Jawaharlal Nehru ) University and indulged in lawlessness there. The University authorities could not stop it and even the police could not come on time.
74 74 So beyond speculation from the press, there is nothing further I can add in respect of that ongoing process.
76 76 This approach calls for easing policy more aggressively than would be prescribed by the central outlook for activity and inflation when policy rates are close to their lower bound. The additional easing provided by such a strategy removes some of the downward bias to inflation outcomes introduced by the [ effective lower bound ]. If it is understood by a sufficient proportion of agents, and affects their expectations, it becomes even more powerful,.
81 81 We oversee the insurance sector, and we see the actual physical manifestations of extreme weather events, and we see where that 's likely to go,.
87 87 Business saved some of the tax cut, but most of it seems to have gone on stock buybacks and dividends,.
93 93 As soon as other countries started engaging in social distancing, we started to imagine what it would mean for Harvard.
94 94 a lot of expertise we could lean on.
96 96 But equally, I am clear that achieving our legally binding commitments will require everyone to consider what they can do to ensure they play their part in driving the sector towards a low-carbon, sustainable future.
97 97 I do n't know why he 'd really want to come to the Dolphins. He 's probably one of the fiercest competitors there is, and we 're at the stage with the Dolphins where we 're trying to build a team for the future.
99 99 It seems like I had a death sentence but was pardoned at the last minute,.
103 103 It was n't doing badly when he came in, that 's not true, but I think it 's done better than most of this group ( those at the WEF ) would have expected. It 's been a good 10 years and his 3 years probably better than expected.
105 105 I do n't think anyone knows how big.
106 106 I think for a lot of companies now this is very much a back-to-business moment of, what is your core business, and what is the core service you 're providing ?.
112 112 We find that the [ current ] penalties are not deterring enough. We want to ensure they would have a deterrent effect and they must be proportionately high,.
114 114 We have to have this debate, but I think you have to also go step by step,.
116 116 Yeah, there are definitely issues that come with that but I think if that 's what it takes to win, we 're going to do it,.
119 119 could create the right incentives to spur investment by strengthening financial systems, building confidence in financial markets, and enabling more productive private sector activity.
122 122 many countries will need debt relief. This is the only way they can concentrate any new resources on fighting the pandemic and its economic and social consequences.
130 130 The only way this lockdown can get any worse is if the ice cream vans start booting round the streets blasting Rkid 's new tunes out he he,.
134 134 Unfortunately we did n't manage the stop the Brexit bus but we can try and protect the people of Scotland from the crash. That 's our priority.
140 140 should be considered, with some serious thought about how to mitigate against the fraud concern,.
148 148 While some countries try to divide the world, the Asian countries should try to unite the world,.
154 154 We have to save our own people first. If someone loses their job, they can be given more money than that,.
158 158 In creating this series it was most important for me to consider what I believe to be the ultimate question and challenge of telling a story about the Holocaust : how do I do so without borrowing from a real person 's specific life or experience ?.
162 162 It 's a new virus which none of us have met before. Our immune system has not been exposed to it and therefore we 've no natural immunity to it. So I can understand why that causes significant public concern.
165 165 One can see a state that is governing daily. When the pandemic caused by coronavirus emerged, each country came up with a strategy. What is our strategy ?.
172 172 You can not say the yield curve is a good predictor in general. Sometimes it is, sometimes it is n't,.
176 176 At the time, the drama was unfolding in a much worse manner, if I may. The idea that we had an absolute necessity to co-ordinate action at the level of the major central banks was something very natural. I am not sure it was really more appropriate in this time. It could have also had an impact of panicking if I may, or giving the message of too much of a panic.
177 177 By law, we would oblige the Gambling Authority to set clear rules and to make notes that would change every time,.
179 179 with their extensive know-how and deep pockets, oil and gas companies can play a crucial role in accelerating deployment of key renewable options such as offshore wind, while also enabling some key capital-intensive clean energy technologies -- such as carbon capture, utilization, and storage and hydrogen -- to reach maturity,.
180 180 Hydogen can help overcome many difficult energy challenges. It can decarbonise hard-to-abate-sectors like steel, chemicals, trucks, ships and planes. Hydrogen can also enhance energy security by diversifying the fuel mix and providing flexibility to balance grids.
181 181 With their extensive know-how and deep pockets, oil and gas companies can play a crucial role in accelerating deployment of key renewable options such as offshore wind, while also enabling some key capital-intensive clean energy technologies -- such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage, and hydrogen -- to reach maturity,.
183 183 if current market conditions continue, ( developing nations' ) income from oil and gas will fall by 50 % to 85 % in 2020, reaching the lowest levels in more than two decades, according to recent IEA analysis.
184 184 This would mean that there will still be huge pressures on global oil markets,.
185 185 We may see it was the worst year in the history of global markets,.
186 186 Saudi Arabia, which has been a stabiliser of oil markets for many years can once again play a constructive role and as chair of the G-20 can bring all key economies of the world, producers and consumers together, to have a dialogue to take measures to try to stabilise the oil markets.
188 188 Financial market regulators and supervisors could also encourage, on a temporary and time-bound basis, extensions of loan maturities.
191 191 We always think of fiscal consolidation also from a medium term perspective, so I think it is very important for the government to signal such commitment to fiscal prudence going forward and of course the details of the spending also matters, it is not just what your fiscal deficit is, it is what your spending on that matters.
193 193 If they dressed too formally, they were called sexless bluestockings ; if they wore eye-catching or feminine outfits, they were trivialised and condescended to.
194 194 Support rapidly needs to be extended to the self-employed and freelancers, to increase the rate of statutory sick pay to the real living wage to help those who are sick or self-isolating, and for the Government to take the ambitious steps required to support the over five million self-employed people in the UK through this crisis.
195 195 In a low-interest-rate environment, central banks should err on the side of caution when downside risks emerge. With more power to lower inflation than to raise it, monetary policymakers might be inclined to overreact with too much stimulus and, if needed, hike rates later to correct course,.
196 196 You are able to pay your employees for another month if you get support.
200 200 the most likely forecast,.
201 201 This is a very old hat. It 's almost always the case that presidents would rather interest rates be kept lower than the Fed would want them.
202 202 If you want the banking system to be liquid, do n't encourage banks to hold more reserves than necessary by making it more attractive to hold them,.
207 207 And if there 's one sector I think a lot of people want improved, it 's the funeral industry.
208 208 They should consider how the government might respond in the extreme,.
215 215 politics is the art of making selfish desires seem like the national interest.
217 217 It 's simple : before any administration -- Democratic or Republican -- sends Americans into battle, those of us in Congress should have to debate the merits and take a vote,.
218 218 Given the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 epidemic, everyone should be prepared to work from home unexpectedly,.
220 220 Investors can take heart that we 've counteracted this existential shock with the greatest fiscal and monetary bazooka,.
223 223 Our valued US customers can be confident that their calls, questions, maintenance, and support needs will all answered promptly and efficiently,.
226 226 I just wanted it not to have happened. I had just been sexually assaulted by Alex Salmond. I felt like absolute hell but I did n't want to think about it. I did n't want anyone to know this guy had touched me or been like that with me. He had other women and I did n't want to be considered as that.
228 228 During that outbreak ( Ebola ), west Africa struggled, the WHO could n't get their people in, they could n't get biological samples out, and the economic impact of being shut off made things worse.
229 229 Wearing a mask all the time will be ineffective. It will allow viruses to be transmitted around it, through it and worse still, if it becomes moist it will encourage the growth of viruses and bacteria,.
230 230 Avoid touching your face. If you cough or sneeze, it 's important to cover your face with a sleeve. Better yet, a tissue to be disposed of carefully, and then sanitising the hands afterwards. Washing your hands and drying them is the best procedure. When that 's not easy to do, alcohol-based sanitiser is a good second-best.
236 236 Most of our callers are in poverty or low income trying to navigate the system and find resources to help them in their time of need.
238 238 That 's likely still the case with the forthcoming January reading.
239 239 It did n't give a sense that they were thought through at all.
243 243 The hard stop did n't really begin until late last week and it 's unraveled rapidly over the last few days. I do n't think the report 's going to pick that up, just because of the timing. It 'll be clear we have a problem. It 'll be unclear how big of a problem.
251 251 would do well to use the world 's most prominent pulpit to exhort businesses to behave with a stronger sense of morality,.
252 252 You 'd do these things if you were on the other side of this competition.
253 253 And this is where I unhappily come to the conclusion that unless we reverse that, the ambition of 10 per cent growth or double digit growth which is very much realisable for India, I think will not get realised,.
254 254 At some point, it should occur to you that what you 've been asked to do is not judging at all.
255 255 I do n't think that in another two months we 'll be in a situation where it 's like nothing happened ; that scenario is too optimistic,.
258 258 This could be huge if it goes on for months,.
262 262 It 's not cyclical unemployment. It 's quarantine unemployment. Businesses are n't allowed to operate. People are n't allowed to be out of their home. The idea that if you just give people money it 'll somehow prevent the unemployment rate from skyrocketing makes no sense. No amount of demand stimulus will get people to go to restaurants if they 're closed.
263 263 The economic damage done to China implies that China can not grow more than 4 percent this year,.
265 265 you can not fool all of the investors all the time,.
267 267 The results from our study may therefore not be as worrying as they first seem, if it means more teachers who are struggling with their mental health are now getting help. However, more needs to done to monitor and improve the mental health and wellbeing of the teaching profession -- similar to the commitment that has been made to track teachers' workloads over time,.
268 268 There could be some signalling that they will look at the measure of inflation they target and there 's also discussion over whether they should discuss the policy tools available.
270 270 This package would represent a very important step in the U.S. response to the coronavirus pandemic.
272 272 The meaningful decline in the union membership rate among local government workers ( from 40.3 % to 39.4 % ) might suggest Janus is having its intended effect,.
275 275 Only 9.2 % of workers in the lowest quartile of the wage distribution can telework, compared to 61.5 % of workers in the highest quartile,.
283 283 far too many talented public servants are abandoning the middle levels of government, and too many of the best recruits are rethinking their commitment, either because they are fed up with the constraints of outmoded personnel systems and unmet expectations for advancement or simply lured away by the substantial difference between public and private sector salaries in many areas.
284 284 if the choice were to be at zero or slightly negative, to be at zero is a good place to be.
287 287 With the developing situation, we see that [ the coronavirus ] will continue to have a severe impact in April and May before we see a recovery in public health and the economy,.
293 293 the housing bubble burst in 2006, the first financial tremors were in 2007 and the major financial events were spread out from February through September of 2008. What would take years in a financial crisis has happened in days in this health crisis.
297 297 While we are not assuming an Italy-style national shutdown in the US, the experience of countries like Italy, Spain and France offers some indications of the impact that extreme local quarantines could have,.
298 298 There are good reasons to think that when people in different political camps cease to respect each other, it 's harder to make political compromises and create good public policy,.
299 299 We do n't need Amazon 's FDI to make India 5 trillion dollar economy, if at all we have to achieve this, then it will through our own strength of business and trade.
305 305 So we have to prioritise, cutting back or delaying less-important expenditures, while refocusing on immediate needs.
307 307 Such a re-written history would bring out the amazing continuity of a nation, which nation asserted its identity again and again at times of war and political crises,.
309 309 The statue of Minnesota requires first an application, and then the regulators decide, not only whether there is need, but also whether the opening of a new hospital, or adding beds, hurts the competitor,.
310 310 Think if you 're plant burned down, how would you rebuild,.
311 311 Very obvious .... Fascism implies unreason. Unreason suggests a belief and a way of establishing the truth value of a propagation. Unreason actually makes RSS propaganda into truth .... Against this unreason, the intelligentsia and the most active element of the intelligentsia is the students,.
312 312 Would she look urgently at the hardship scheme as well as the compensation scheme because too many people, including someone I have been contacted about today who is currently homeless, are still struggling to get any support at all.
313 313 You do n't have to say, ` Hey Dad, are you leaving me all of your money ?' Try instead, ` I 'm thinking of doing a will for my family and I wanted to know how you went about doing yours.' Approach it from a place of caring and respect.
314 314 Another opportunity seems to arise after the death of someone close to the family occurs.
317 317 Efforts to make the production of high-protein foods more sustainable must continue,.
325 325 If the government carries on with its current policies, growth could be less than 5 % as we have been slowing consistently !.
328 328 The economic growth expectations have declined further, with the potential for a technical recession if the December numbers for manufacturing comes out and are as weak as they were in November. We also have jobs bloodbath at companies like Telkom and Walmart.
332 332 the U.S. will hit a peak in deaths in the next two-three weeks, as the doubling time seems to be about two-three days.
338 338 We should open up these cities to allow medical resources to get in, and to stop this human tragedy that is happening.
339 339 With coastal areas under increasing threat from more powerful storms due to climate change, it 's critical to prevent further destruction of existing wetlands. Government should also actively seek to restore wetlands that have been lost.
340 340 Men are four times more likely than women to ask for a raise.
342 342 This industry is going to have more taxes, not less taxes, and I think you all know it,.
353 353 This has been a very difficult decision but we think it 's for the best ....
356 356 I do n't think the Europeans are worried about how weak the euro is,.
357 357 The ties to China, exposure to the coronavirus, compounded by Japan 's own domestic challenges is bolstering fears that the world 's third-largest economy is likely contracting for the second consecutive quarter,.
361 361 If you look at some place like Sweden, Sweden has a very laissez-faire, very targeted approach, and they 're doing very well. The kindergartens are still open, the grade schools are still open, most factories are still open in Sweden. They are not imposing this sledgehammer and essentially wiping out the economy,.
364 364 But a large price decline or persistent price declines are unlikely,.
365 365 Mortgage rates are expected to hold under 4 % for most of 2020, while net job creation will likely exceed two million,.
366 366 Some companies are still afraid of losing control through allowing employees to work from home or are afraid of giving them more flexible working hours -- but our study clearly shows that there 's no reason for this.
369 369 Our institutions have to maintain integrity in admissions by not giving away seats to students from wealthy families who may be academically underqualified,.
370 370 We wanted the building to be in a nonspecific location for the US version -- the feeling that it could be anywhere,.
371 371 I think that the odds of a global recession are close to 100 percent right now,.
376 376 They see everybody on Facebook wishing everybody a happy and a joyous Passover ( who ) forget about people like them who do n't have anybody or anything to share the joys of Passover with.
377 377 With this gene therapy, you can use a patient 's own stem cells instead of donor cells for a transplant,.
379 379 I agree that Aam Admi Party has done good work in the field of health and education, but the party is also lenient towards anti-social elements. Recently, it supported those who are protesting against Citizenship Amendment Act. AAP has not taken the right step in supporting them. On the other hand, the BJP government at the Centre, in the last few months, has done what earlier seemed impossible. Be it the abrogation of Article 370 or passing the Citizenship Amendment Bill.
382 382 This test was a critical step towards enabling our aircraft with a high-bandwidth communication system that can not be jammed or detected by an adversary,.
384 384 At the end of the day I think we have to accept to have a democratic discussion about what is property of reasonable magnitude,.
397 397 This can put patients at risk of missing treatment as well as being confused or misinformed about their healthcare needs,.
399 399 Even with your tiny house edge, you are making 1 % an hour and if you have n't blown tons of money on too many bells and whistles, you just ca n't lose. People love to gamble. Nothing 's changed.
404 404 If you can tide firms over and thereby reduce the severity of bankruptcies and firings, you can expedite the return to normal.
407 407 Overall, the theory behind reducing the availability of LCMs to reduce the number of victims in mass shootings makes sense, and our empirical results suggest that LCM bans have saved lives,.
410 410 The factory is getting ready for manufacturing. It will be ready by July or August,.
411 411 This will help in the advocacy for clean energy by delivering energy solutions. From today this service would be available in our post offices nationwide on demand by customers.
413 413 The best thing any U.S. administration can do is inhibit the regime 's ability to shut down the internet and repress people in darkness,.
415 415 The signing of the Phase 1 deal would represent a welcome, even if modest, de-escalation of trade hostilities between China and the U.S.,.
416 416 We should welcome and harness global talent, not push it away.
418 418 Companies will write-off late winter and early spring this year, and if coronavirus returns after the summer, it will be a financial disaster.
419 419 Currently the big banks are funding the big industries while small scale industries are being funded by the cooperatives. The BFIs should pay attention to loan disbursement to the SMEs in an easy and convenient manner for inclusive growth of the industrial sector.
420 420 We had two-and-a-half months to do the report and the Government has sat on it for three months which seems to me a bit of travesty. They obviously do n't like the conclusions,.
421 421 Helping other people makes me feel incredibly good, it 's like an addiction. My grandparents lived in a poor neighborhood in North Philadelphia, but they still managed to give money every week to the church across the street. My grandmother said if they had enough money after putting food on the table, how could they not help someone that needed it more. That always stuck with me.
422 422 If you see your neighbors and you 're tempted to stop and talk, that 's fine. But be courteous to others using the sidewalk. Take your conversation to a place where you can maintain a 6-foot distance.
426 426 The extent to which the Bank of Japan and the ECB have been holding corporate and private sector bonds or equities creates risk that could be a concern,.
431 431 I suspect that the real issue is that global oil demand growth might slow, and one day decline, while alternative oil supply is cheaper than oilsands.
432 432 Most jobs in finance or insurance have a chance to continue with some degree of normalcy through the crisis, as they can be performed at home away from others. For just about everyone that works in hotels or restaurants, this is not an option.
436 436 The AfCFTA could be the most important opportunity offered to African countries in a long time. This is because, for many years, the absence of a regional economic framework has limited the continent 's development,.
439 439 We should pause to remark that COVID-19 is extraordinarily successful epidemiologically, precisely because it is not extremely lethal,.
440 440 Despite the strides being made, we implore all Nigerians to adhere to stipulated social distancing guidelines, and practice regular hand washing as directed by the World Health Organization. We are positive that we can beat the spread of the virus, if we all comply with the safety measures as advised by the NCDC and WHO.
443 443 In humans, flavonols similarly protect us from free radicals, products of oxidative metabolism. Flavonol intake also may be beneficial through influence on the partner microorganisms we have in the gut, the microbiota.
444 444 Organizations should be able to easily secure their workloads across public, private, and hybrid clouds without requiring multiple tools or creating a management headache,.
445 445 is likely to be largely wasted on propping up stockholders.
446 446 The economy is in dire times, everything is going downwards, if the trend continues banks will close down, NBFCs will close down and ( it will ) lead to disaster,.
448 448 I have been writing letters to PM Modi since 2015 on the economic policies, but he is not listening. It may be because, I am the ` Jamai' ( brother-in-law ) as my wife is from Gujarat. I am ready to give the blueprint for the economic success.
449 449 Security means ensuring the presence of police by having police stations on campus. Today we have to call the police ; It takes time. Having a police station is important for college campuses in the country. This is not just for JNU, but we must start with JNU,.
451 451 India should recognize the strength of the PSUs.
452 452 If you want 10 per cent growth rate, the investment rate to the GDP should be 37 per cent and 3.7 per cent should be your efficiency factor and not 5 per cent as it is today. Efficiency in use of capital should be the objective,.
453 453 During P. V. Narasimha Rao 's time, we worked on the economic reforms as a result of which the GDP reached 8 per cent. If our PM works on my suggestions, then our GDP will reach 10 per cent,.
454 454 We have n't said anything against Muslims. We have only said those who have been persecuted for religious reasons, who had been hanging ( sic ) in this country for decades without citizenship, those who have not got cards and jobs .... This state of affairs must end.
459 459 Existing-home sales are off to a strong start at 5.46 million. The trend line for housing starts is increasing and showing steady improvement, which should ultimately lead to more home sales.
460 460 There 's an acute shortage of workers, and the cost would be much less than college tuition.
462 462 If you look across the United States and across other countries, the unemployment rate can go up very quickly, but it ca n't come back down very quickly. It never has. A business whose balance sheet is in tatters after nine months without revenues might go bankrupt, it might go out of business, or it wo n't be in position to hire people back immediately even if demand returns,.
463 463 Misinformation during times of a health crisis can spread paranoia, fear and stigmatisation. It can also result in people being left unprotected or more vulnerable to the virus,.
464 464 that avoiding ice cream and other old foods can prevent the onset of the disease,.
467 467 The unique Postgraduate Teaching Hub will accommodate growth and will mean we can place business skills at the very heart of our PGT student experience, enhancing employability and adding value to a wide range of programmes across the University.
468 468 We will certainly be seeking the highest penalties we can get to send a message to Trivago, and to send a message to others, not to mislead consumers,.
470 470 I 'm not at all surprised that there is an impression that they are not thinking about aggressive pricing-I 'm fairly certain they 're not,.
471 471 It 's extremely concerning that the prices that Australian producers can get when they sell gas internationally is often a lot less than what they can get when they sell it domestically,.
472 472 with monetary policy hampered and fiscal policy the main game in town, we should expect more volatile business cycles.
473 473 The economic tools we are using are important, but it 's a natural catastrophe or war -- we are in the middle of it and just getting out of it is kind of the main thing right now.
476 476 But it is not documentary. And it was never purported to be. In creating this series it was most important for me to consider what I believe to be the ultimate question and challenge of telling a story about the Holocaust : How do I do so without borrowing from a real person 's specific life or experience ?.
480 480 help U.K. businesses and households manage through an economic shock that could prove large and sharp, but should be temporary,.
481 481 economic shock that could prove large but will ultimately be temporary.
482 482 We referred the incident and the parties involved in the incident, which would include not just the technical party related to the audio link, but the parties who used the information,.
485 485 Sterling tumbled in early trade and failed to regain composure after BoE 's Mark Carney hinted that more stimulus could be on the cards.
490 490 If you look at something like Myanmar, we did n't have voices on the ground. We did n't know what imminent harm was, and a post that would look pretty benign outside, if you understood the situation on the ground, absolutely was much more harmful.
493 493 I think you explain it a couple of ways. One, you explain it that we 're protecting us from being sick. When they say, ` But we 're kids, we ca n't get sick,' you explain that the more people are home and shelter at home, the more you 're protecting health workers,.
494 494 This difference has a huge ripple effect. Women need to shift from thinking ` I 'm not ready to do that' to thinking ` I want to do that -- and I 'll learn by doing it.'.
500 500 made it plain that the UK is no longer seeking the kind of access to vital EU databases and security tools that would replicate our existing relationship, despite its own analysis stating repeatedly that failing to participate in existing tools would mean a serious loss of capability with damaging consequences for public safety.
508 508 In search of yield, institutions are more open to take higher risk, and that risk buildup ought to be the center of attention,.
515 515 I do n't think any bondholder will accept a restructuring if you do n't already have an agreement with the fund,.
518 518 Gender inequality remains widespread across countries and regions. IMF research shows that countries can not fully prosper without tapping into all its talent,.
521 521 urgently seeking $ 18bn in new loan resources for the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust, and will also likely need at least $ 1.8 bn in subsidy resources.
524 524 But it seems prudent to expect a healthy drop in March and April, and perhaps May, too,.
526 526 The sharp downturn in growth apparently promised by the weakening of business surveys from the spring through the early fall has not materialized,.
527 527 though it 's not clear if all of these calls led to a formal claim.
529 529 the next decade must see unprecedented levels of collaboration if we are to meet global climate, biodiversity and Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ). 1t. org presents an important example of how stakeholders from all walks of life can work to achieve a single, globally significant goal.
538 538 After the 2009 financial crisis, the coronavirus could become the second textbook case where a coordinated European stimulus package makes sense,.
540 540 In particular, we prohibited sending requests to them before May 1 about paying taxes.
542 542 should not confuse regional and federal prerogatives.
543 543 It is North Yorkshire County Council 's formula and ( the scheme of 19 people ) is the way county is dividing things up, but we could say we are prepared to take more,.
547 547 I certainly would n't go to Russia for medical treatment,.
548 548 The people who are most vulnerable right now, the one who have just had their hours cut or find themselves unemployed are also the people who do n't typically have great big super balances anyway. If you 're a young person, you may not even have $ 20,000.
549 549 But it 's got to be remembered that the survey was conducted before we saw those queues around Centrelink ... I think the general consensus is expecting the unemployment rate to reach 10 per cent.
550 550 This is either going to bring out the worst in us or it 's already beginning to bring out the best in us, as times of crisis often do,.
552 552 As sick people come to hospital E.R. s, and as they are admitted to hospitals, we can expect the number of people getting surprise medical bills to explode,.
553 553 But it 's also stretching out our imagination about ugly scenarios that could occur -- and that makes having implicit insurance, i.e. lower greenhouse gas emissions, more attractive.
556 556 Gloves are probably even worse, because people put on gloves and then touch everything they would have touched with their hands. So it just becomes another way of transferring micro-organisms. And inside the gloves, your hands get hot and sweaty, which is a really good environment for microbes to grow.
557 557 He is always thinking of other people and what he can do to help others,.
571 571 Research indicates that first-gen students disproportionately experience barriers to accessing support and have a diminished sense of belonging. I am committed to helping them meet these challenges. The first and most important thing we can do is to help students make connections with the countless people across campus who believe in them and are eager to help them succeed.
576 576 could play a leading role in boosting market stability.
578 578 Why should n't HP take the money and run at this point ?.
583 583 Economists have a really hard time saying over 50 % probability of recession. I assure you, almost every economist out there is thinking over 50 % probability,.
591 591 Those who require their proceeds to be remitted back to China can now do so.
595 595 A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing, for example in particular age groups.
603 603 The Netherlands are currently leading a group of countries that oppose this strategy, and Germany also seems to want to follow this group,.
607 607 Just by making the data available, she could change the world.
608 608 If that happens, we can win the war against the virus and the markets and the economy will soar,.
611 611 I learned that it takes a lifetime to build a reputation, and someone can destroy it in a few days.
613 613 But it is still too soon to even speculate about either the size or the persistence of these effects, or whether they will lead to a material change in the outlook,.
615 615 amply vindicated. People rushed to banks to exchange their holdings of old notes for new notes, but as there was a shortage of new notes, amounts handed over to banks could only be credited to their bank accounts, from which cash withdrawals were permitted on a restricted basis until the supply of new notes could catch up with demand. The shortage of cash disrupted agricultural markets and operations in the informal sector, both of which are highly cash-dependent.
617 617 For most Americans in other quintiles to envy or resent those in the top quintile,.
619 619 Imagine how much faster the research would advance if these researchers were working in collaboration, sharing the results with others, and posting them on the web so the researchers throughout the world could learn from them,.
620 620 We will absolutely not accept the actions of anyone who thinks they can get away with assaulting an emergency worker, and we will always look to take action and seek prosecution for those individuals that commit such offences.
622 622 Most of these cowardly acts currently take place with little or no consequences.
626 626 The U.S. is already running trillion-dollar deficits, which should n't be increased unless there 's a real need to do so,.
629 629 A U.S.-China Phase I deal, if durable, is expected to reduce the cumulative negative impact of trade tensions on global GDP by end 2020 -- from 0.8 percent to 0.5 percent,.
631 631 Governments could offer temporary and targeted credit guarantees for the near-term liquidity needs of these firms. For example, Korea has expanded lending for business operations and loan guarantees for affected small - and medium-sized enterprises,.
634 634 Understandably, there is concern about what acquittal means for the # MeToo movement against sexual harassment and assault. I do n't think it needs to have any adverse implications for that important and necessary cause, because jury trials are not and must not be part of any broader movement. If the crown brought forward a flawed case -- and it did -- the failure belongs to it alone, not to wider campaigns for equality and social justice,.
635 635 I thought it meant that he would try to have sex with me, to have sexual relations with me.
637 637 you can think of this as the true launch of GitLab 's global channel program,.
640 640 I like his madness. And I do n't give a shit whether City fans do n't like it or if there 's a few of them whinging that probably were n't even fucking born to know who he fucking even is. So kiss my arse.
646 646 I intend to retire as solo artist after album no3 as I have just had a call from my brother begging me to start oasis again in 2022 if you believe in life after love c 'm on you know LG x ( sic ).
649 649 Our scenarios show that even a contained outbreak could significantly impact the global economy in the short run,.
650 650 This is truly what we are facing. I 'm sorry to say it, it 's my country and I 'm not very happy to say it, but it 's an imperial power in decline and it 's a dangerous country right now and it will be absolutely dangerous if Trump wins re-election.
651 651 We are at an early stage at looking at what NATO can do.
659 659 Again, the new NAFTA will not solve the climate crisis or remedy this administration 's most egregious environmental rollbacks, and if it was solely an environmental agreement, I could not vote for it,.
662 662 And the next one is they 've got to use fiscal policy in a very targeted way to support demand -- and I think the government has made it quite clear that that is what they 're looking to do.
663 663 Decreasing class sizes is just about the most expensive thing you can do,.
664 664 I do n't think that there 's any chance that by the end of the year the level of GDP, the unemployment rate, any measure of well-being for the economy, is not going to be higher at the end of the year than it was at the beginning of the year, and certainly not higher than you would have predicted.
665 665 I have asked my officials to immediately engage with the RSA to introduce measures that will address issues arising from the suspension of these services. It is critical that we give drivers as well as operators of commercial vehicles peace of mind in relation to the status of their licence, learner permit, NCT certificate or certificate of roadworthiness, especially if it has expired or is likely to expire during the period of the Covid-19 health crisis,.
670 670 Loan guarantees and direct cash transfers will stave off bankruptcy and default on debt, but these measures can not restore the output that is lost when social distancing keeps people from producing goods and services.
672 672 The federal government or any of the provincial government or any specific institution can not do this job alone, but we will have to make joint efforts to cope with challenges of Covid-19,.
673 673 This is an issue we have to think about as a country. My main purpose is not to criticise but to present facts. This is also a challenge for the government.
674 674 Put together, it makes the country 's economic environment toxic. It 's for this reason that we have to encourage public-private sector collaboration as soon as possible, and that can be done by bringing back Malaysia Inc,.
675 675 The biggest obstacle is not that people are concerned about a carbon tax or cap-and-trade, but they would love performance standards,.
677 677 You can look at the state of the world and say, ` This is the outcome of 8 billion rational people, and this is the best we can get ?' Or you can look at it and say, ` This is the outcome of 8 billion irrational people working in a suboptimal system and there is lots of room for improvement.
680 680 We will talk to the UDF because MCP does not look promising ... we can also enter into an alliance with DPP or Mutharika resigns and I take over, or he dies and I take over.
682 682 How long that remains the case for we can only wait and see,.
683 683 Obviously if there is unemployment, which accrues within the industry, then those unemployed workers would be entitled to the same consideration as anyone else through the Commonwealth package,.
685 685 Without programmes to reduce widespread risks, or to insure or otherwise respond to the remaining risks, farmers are often unable to accumulate enough capital to invest,.
694 694 The ruble became much stronger last year and the accumulated effect of such strengthening is still manifesting now. The ruble remains stronger than a year ago even if January fluctuations are taken into consideration. The effect of the last-year change of the currency rate and its disinflationary effect will be exhausted in the first half of the year,.
699 699 It may be part of a developing consensus within at least part of the Beijing policy-making elite that China will pay an unacceptable price if it does not allow GDP growth rates to drop substantially,.
708 708 The fiscal-monetary distinction may break down.
714 714 I do n't think going after the child of a vice president is going to move any undecided voter,.
717 717 In a tail-risk bad-case scenario, a further spread of the virus and severe restrictions on normal activities would prolong the recession through the second half of 2020 before a rebound starts in early 2021,.
720 720 it would be all spending that therefore would add to the deficit,.
723 723 would be the best administrator to run this country.
726 726 You worry about people being underpaid partly on an equity basis, but more on whether or not they 'll be discouraged from accepting Medicare patients ... What you want is to get the payment right while you try to save money. Underpaying can lead to undesirable consequences, just like overpaying can.
727 727 A lot of this depends on the horizon. I wish pension plans had these longer horizons. Buffett makes it happen even though he has shareholders, and pension funds seemingly have long horizons but they do n't act like it. They should be long illiquidity and welcoming a negative skew because they can ride out a GFC.
730 730 More and more people could actually be tempted to buy online. This is actually what 's happening in China by the way. The sales are up 20 per cent year to year online because people do n't necessarily want to go into a store physically or do n't want to physically be present with other people just because they 're scared of contracting the disease.
731 731 But if it goes on and reaches the 20 day mark, or the 30 day mark you have to get your money -- you have to cover your cost. So, you may actually see [ food ] prices fluctuate a little bit.
733 733 I think we are really well calibrated now.
741 741 A day off of work for them can have quite a financial impact, especially when you consider things like how low the minimum wage is, so those workers are much more likely to have to go into work when they 're sick,.
742 742 All hell is breaking loose : What can I do to protect myself ? I 'll get a gun,.
743 743 [ T ] he evidence is overwhelming that a gun in the home increases the likelihood not only that a household member will be shot accidentally, but also that someone in the home will die in a suicide or homicide.
747 747 That 's why all government institutions were asked to accelerate spending, including spending that would support tourism,.
748 748 We really have to have more teeth in the fines and penalties so that they can have a deterrent effect,.
757 757 That is why I have decided to convene a Task Force comprised of administration, faculty, students, alumni, and outside experts to evaluate the adequacy of our policies in protecting our culture of mutual respect, trust, and support and the feeling of safety for all of our students. And I would like the work of this task force to include a review of the impact of social media and anonymous messages on our culture.
762 762 We just want the commission and the government to set up a fair and equitable playing field where the Amazons and Flipkarts can not abuse the system with unfair subsidies and their favoured traders.
767 767 This is a pretty rough thing to say but I think we need to ram that home to them, we need to make it perfectly clear that if any country wants to trade with the international community and engage with the international community they are extremely welcome but there are certain standards that have to be met,.
772 772 The theme of the fest is ` Umeed' which means hope. In today 's time and age hope is required for everything. ` Umeed par akash thama hua hai'. If there is no hope life will become insipid. The programmes like VOXA, gives the students of the college a chance to discover their hidden talent in singing,.
773 773 The truth is there is no Bad Boys without or. They 're the heart and soul of this movie, and we nobody can take that away,.
776 776 A year ago we applied for our licence to be transferred to a new company which would help us to deal with legacy issues that were left over from when we took over the running of the company.
781 781 However, we may not see a dramatic rise in growth numbers due to the fact that as growth prospects improve, the authorities feel less need to support growth via monetary or fiscal policy.
782 782 Investors are looking past the fourth quarter of 2019, and there is concern that the coronavirus may spur another quarterly contraction, with tourism and trade being hit,.
785 785 Let the People Rule ; How Direct Democracy Can Meet the Populist Challenge.
788 788 This ` phase three' package should finance a sizable amount of household consumption ( including through a major expansion of unemployment insurance ), give fiscal aid to state governments, provide a payroll tax credit to businesses to not lay off workers, ramp up direct government purchases of things like medical equipment to help fight the virus, and make sure the duration of all measures to address the coronavirus economic shock are determined by economic conditions, not arbitrary timelines.
789 789 These reasons make it difficult to isolate the effects of trade policy uncertainty, and possibly result in an upward bias of its effects on the global economy,.
790 790 A practical tip is to wear older shoes or boots that you do n't mind getting a bit of mud on during this rainy, soggy time of year,.
793 793 I do n't think we took time enough to explain to people what was involved. I think, later on, people have understood it better. For example, people thought that one district one factory meant one new factory per district. No, that was never the case.
794 794 If you just want to give up on downtown Clearwater, then just scrap the park and put some walking trails and some playground equipment and a little stage and call it a day.
797 797 There are places where fiscal spending can actually produce an immediate boost in demand,.
798 798 When officers of the administrative service resign from their dream jobs because they do not believe they can serve in good faith, they are living testimony that the sacrifices made by the generations that got us freedom still inspire emulation,.
799 799 The first sign of difficulties in India often seems in foreign exchange. So far compared to other emerging markets our exchange rate has stayed quite stable, presumably from some support of the Reserve Bank of India. I should say we have depreciated some against the dollar, but you know countries like Brazil have gone down 25 per cent. We have n't been in that situation,.
806 806 Washington state 's history is a sorry litany of big businesses making threats that if you do n't give them this or that, they will take away jobs,.
810 810 We project the recovery will take about six months starting in mid-March or April,.
811 811 While market functioning has been able to withstand large swings in asset prices so far, anecdotal evidence suggests that liquidity has been tightening in many markets.
812 812 You need to ensure your governance processes empower staff to ... prioritise doing the right thing even if that might have some negative financial effects.
814 814 For example, if you plug a machine learning model into a datastream that was n't designed for that model, it may start making inferences and decisions that negatively affect people 's lives,.
816 816 Given that these companies are so high-risk, you sort of have to think through that,.
822 822 The next six months are likely to be painful,.
825 825 In 2019, households paid $ 1,200 more for goods because of the China trade war. Was anyone in this room hurt by the increased cost of underwear or plasma TVs at CostCo ?.
828 828 The economy is still being supported by very firm private sector spending, and that is a positive development in our economy. More importantly, private investment might turn around,.
831 831 unemployed, people with low income and cash on hand or [ those ] who have maxed out their credit cards, including people with good jobs who are temporarily illiquid,.
832 832 We knew they were going to hit shots. But I knew if I come down and hit a shot that 's going to take the momentum all away. And I know big-time players make big-time plays.
835 835 making the exam closed-book at remote settings, without opportunities for monitoring and enforcement, could lead to inequities among students.
836 836 The lockdown is helping overcome the health risk the country faces. However, only by ending the lockdown can we address the economic, social and quality of life challenges,.
837 837 Private schools can suspend even without the permission of DepEd,.
843 843 And they came into a business environment that had been deregulated to the point where there were, more or less, no rules. Smart people were encouraged to grab what they could get.
844 844 Congress will certainly have to do more if the shutdown is prolonged,.
846 846 have a pattern of high-conflict behavior that increases conflict rather than reducing or resolving it.
849 849 We 've had a hard time with health and everything else like that and we thought we could manage ( injuries ) a little better,.
850 850 What I 'm saying is that within the context for the framework for monetary policy, we also have to look at the impact on employment and on stable prices. And if other central banks engage in those unfair practices, it can effect employment.
851 851 A firm that does n't have a lot of competitors may not need to take its profits and reinvest them,.
852 852 Domestic businessmen will take a wait-and-see attitude. In such situations, the effectiveness of government investments ( including the National Projects ) and the question of whether the pension reforms will have a significant effect will become critically important,.
855 855 Once the decision was announced by the ECB that there would be no cricket until at least the end of May it became inevitable the Matt would not be returning to Kent this season.
858 858 Everything has to be on the table. We simply do n't know yet how the crisis would evolve,.
859 859 It does look like that growth for 2020 could be in the region of 1 per cent -- from the 2.25 per cent expected earlier, going by the way the virus has spread, affecting global output and trade in both goods and services,.
860 860 Our legal construct is such that we can not do measures that may be possible for others without this big global responsibility,.
862 862 [ A ] t the top of the income distribution, our research shows that marginal tax rates can be raised without sacrificing economic growth.
863 863 If the pandemic fades in the second half of the year-thus allowing a gradual lifting of containment measures and reopening of the economy-our baseline assumption is for a partial recovery in 2021,.
869 869 The monetary policy space is shrinking and the reliance on fiscal measures as well as on structural reforms to boost growth ought to be stronger,.
870 870 For example, coming with the unified tax system, and the demonetisation that took place. These are steps that over time are beneficial, but of course they might, might be somewhat disruptive over the short term,.
871 871 We should not create uncertainties on our own, when we have plenty that are dumped on us by Mother Nature.
874 874 What helps is concentrating on actions. Who cares if it will be 0.1 or 0.4 or 0.5 ? If we act, and focus on that, lives would be saved, suffering would be reduced and the economy would perk up faster.
877 877 A coordinated fiscal response can boost growth,.
881 881 It is not surprising that in-person courses are, on average, more effective. Being in person with teachers and other students creates social pressures and benefits that can help motivate students to engage. Some students do as well in online courses as in in-person courses, some may do better ; but, on average, students do worse in the online setting, and this is particularly true for students with weaker academic backgrounds. Students who struggle in in-person classes are likely to struggle even more online.
884 884 Taking part can be a spiritually powerful way to lift our hearts in a difficult time by being united in prayer at the same time throughout the world.
886 886 With a combination of a massive supply overhang and a significant demand shock at the same time, the situation we are witnessing today seems to have no equal in oil market history,.
889 889 We need to make sure gas is available in areas where they need it. If you eliminate all coal and you change it with gas, there will be huge reductions in carbon emissions,.
903 903 The trend line for housing starts is increasing and showing steady improvement, which should ultimately lead to more home sales. Mortgage rates have helped with affordability, but it is supply conditions that are driving price growth.
905 905 The rise in the homeownership rate among the younger adults, under 35, and minority households means an increasing number of Americans can build wealth by owning real estate. Still, in order to further expand opportunities, significantly more inventory and home construction are needed at the affordable price points.
906 906 What we may see is GDP growth for the first quarter down substantially, but then in subsequent quarters they 'll likely significantly increase spending,.
916 916 Our volunteers have made a significant impact on the performance of Australia 's broadband, but we can only continue to bring more transparency to this market if more volunteers sign up,.
917 917 So it can be a tricky issue but clearly you ca n't have companies changing terms and conditions after the event.
918 918 We do n't normally comment on any potential investigations but we 've had representations from politicians as well as dealers ( about the Holden shutdown and its impact on dealers and consumers ), so I think it 's appropriate to make some acknowledgement of this,.
920 920 Business cycles usually hit small retail establishments and restaurants ... relatively lightly compared to heavy industries. This one, I think, is going to be the reverse,.
923 923 It did n't finish, it should n't have started. Both of us agreed it would be put behind us,.
926 926 I 'm a fan of privacy, but then again, we are talking about a very unique position, and maybe there should be an exemption.
931 931 I 'm more optimistic than some in believing that we should be able to negotiate a trade deal in this time period-I do n't see why it would be a problem.
938 938 I suppose if they 're coming from those areas we would be taking the same precautions, but it 's difficult to know,.
942 942 Many were already in a difficult debt situation, leaving no space for appropriate health and economic response. We are ready to frontload IDA19 with up to USD 35 billion and identify additional resources. However, we can not have IDA resources go to pay creditors,.
946 946 You do n't have to be an environmentalist to care about protecting the environment. Just ask a farmer who now must rent beehives to pollinate his crops, because there are no longer enough bees in wild nature to do the job for free. But bees do n't send invoices, so the value of their services is not recognized,.
947 947 but the glimmer of hope is that because the recession has been induced by social distancing, in three months or whatever when this has passed ... life can go back to normal. I think that if a vaccine came out reasonably soon, say in the fall, then life could go on pretty fast.
948 948 For Menon to find a place in today 's politics, you need a Nehru, because Krishna Menon would not have been Krishna Menon had Nehru not embraced him intellectually and given him space, got him into politics, got him elected to the Rajya Sabha and then the Lok Sabha and inducted him into the cabinet,.
953 953 Prime Minister Narendra Modi should admit that his economic policies have been unsuccessful that has resulted in a grave economic crisis. He should consult Dr. Manmohan Singh, who was not only the former Prime Minister but a highly acclaimed economist. Mr Modi should talk to him and find a way forward,.
954 954 In the last five months, no meaningful political activity has taken place in Jammu and Kashmir. The Congress party wants that meaningful political activity start in Jammu and Kashmir immediately. Political tourism of taking envoys to Jammu and Kashmir should stop,.
955 955 Provide option to defer tax payments by six months. Extend permission for delayed GST payments, without levy of interest, late fees or penalties, to all statutory payments. Advisory to waive all taxes to local bodies, fixed charges on electrical installations, property taxes for at least next three months,.
956 956 I think within the next year [ low unemployment and slow wage growth ] will remain, and then to the extent that this activity inspires other activity that 's probably also a factor,.
959 959 I would guess the U.S. will hit a peak in deaths in the next two to three weeks, as the doubling time seems to be about two to three days,.
960 960 Is it crazier than having hordes of financial market analysts parsing every word uttered by a monetary official, obsessing over the minutes of the latest Fed meeting, trying to glean clues about what must happen next ? It 's almost as if we 've forgotten how to engage in free enterprise because we 're waiting for marching orders from a central planning agency. I think we 're the rational ones. They like to brand us as ideologues, but, in truth, we 're the realists, and that sobering fact is becoming clearer every day as reality continues to whipsaw global markets.
961 961 Our government is promising so much to so many and at the same time we let the government control the value of our money and all of that would really go against the grain with our Founders -- who did not see it as the government 's task to supply everything to everybody,.
963 963 would not advocate going back to a prior historical monetary arrangement.
968 968 If the U.S. goes into recession, the stock market will be down, everyone will be hurting, and that will undermine the luxury market,.
970 970 If they pass something fast, it 's big and it restores confidence, we could get through this without actually having a recession,.
975 975 You might see some price declines in the Western markets that got very juiced up, very speculative,.
985 985 both parties could not wage war at all, not even knives are produced in their regions.
994 994 We have to move forward and continuously develop the country. The government must solve problems that can be solved ( now ),.
995 995 When smoke inundates your area, people should try to stay indoors,.
997 997 In economic terms, there may be little difference between a no-deal Brexit that could have occurred on the 31st of January, and a hard Brexit that could still occur at the end of 2020,.
1000 1000 Why do people fear terrorism and SARS so much more than automobile accidents and cardiovascular disease ? Because terrorism and SARS seems new and unknown, and therefore uncertain,.
1002 1002 If it turned out the [ coronvirus threat ] was n't so bad, you kind of wanted to make the government bigger [ and ] you kind of wanted to do these transfers anyway, so you 're willing to err on that direction, but clearly the most effective expenditures you could make are ones that address the problem, [ such as ] that build up the health sector.
1004 1004 Having debt rise from 89 % to 90 % is no more discrete an event than having your cholesterol level rise from 199 to 200, or driving your car at 56 miles an hour in 55 mph speed limit,.
1006 1006 On the other hand I do n't think it 's harmful to the Wall Street Journal either. I think it 's very positive to the Wall Street Journal that he is taking the time out of his day to write about this article that they wrote, which just drives people to want to read the article.
1011 1011 as well as being confused or misinformed about their healthcare needs.

1013 1013 If the judge doubts anything, it means that he has questioned the qualifications of FSB employees, and no one wants to get involved with this. The career of both a prosecutor and a judge can be over in a moment,.
1014 1014 If they do n't pay bills monthly and carry a balance with a high interest rate, relying on cash is a good discipline,.
1019 1019 The impact of the coronavirus on earnings may well be underestimated in current stock prices,.
1022 1022 People should not be trivialising this disease-while it is for most a mild to moderate illness, for some it 's not,.

1024 1024 could barely get through the day.
1026 1026 Mark is an enormously, enormously talented guy. He has a great product sense .... People think he does n't understand people. That 's just clearly wrong.
1028 1028 The longer the crisis goes on, the greater the risk to small businesses and to the livelihoods of their owners and employees. We 've listened to small businesses to understand how we can best help them. We 've heard loud and clear that financial support could enable them to keep the lights on and pay people who ca n't come to work.
1029 1029 I recall hearing [ commentator ] Christopher Martin-Jenkins on radio saying ` surely someone, somewhere could come up with something better' and I soon realised that it was a mathematical problem that required a mathematical solution.
1031 1031 You need an unemployment system that in this moment can pivot to 100 percent reimbursement to 100 percent of people who are not at work,.
1034 1034 If the United States is concerned about China, the size and rise of China, then it 's even more important to maintain NATO -- to keep your friends and allies close,.
1036 1036 if Taliban is able to demonstrate real will and real ability to reduce violence, and we see a path to peace.
1038 1038 We will look into how we can step up and speed up our efforts,.
1039 1039 I think the demise of the INF Treaty, which is a bad and negative thing, shows the importance and the strength of NATO,.

1045 1045 misrepresent a real person or borrow from a specific moment in an actual person 's life.
1048 1048 at 6 years old, it was really hard to understand the depths of such horror, such evil. The closest thing I could relate it to was the comic books I loved and the superheroes I followed. It became the lens through which I saw the Holocaust. As I got older, I began to see the reality, the sobering truth and visceral nature of the atrocities.
1051 1051 Things are now questioned about the Holocaust. ` Oh, was it really six million ? Or was it less ?' So it 's a slippery slope of arguments that are made by intellectuals or historians, quote unquote, who try to chip away at the truth for whatever reason, whether they 're anti-Semitic, whether they actually believe this, whether they 're anti-Zionist -- whatever it may be.
1055 1055 Containment measures and fear of infection would hit production as well as spending and drive many of the epidemic affected countries into outright recession,.
1056 1056 One more obstacle to growth is supply bottlenecks. I think the most obvious one is the frequent power outages. Those take a really heavy toll on aggregate supply,.
1059 1059 I do n't think there has been anyone in Australia whose heart has not broken somewhat by this despair, but our budgets can only stretch so far,.
1065 1065 Sounds more like you 've been making fun of Trump for ` years' and you 're scared he might find out this time and shut you out ( again ).
1066 1066 The current pandemic expands the argument : capitalist globalization now appears biologically unsustainable in the absence of a truly international public health infrastructure. But such an infrastructure will never exist until peoples' movements break the power of Big Pharma and for-profit healthcare. This requires an independent socialist design for human survival that includes -- but goes beyond -- a Second New Deal. Since the days of Occupy, progressives have successfully placed the struggle against income and wealth inequality on page one -- a great achievement. But now socialists must take the next step and, with the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries as immediate targets, advocate social ownership and the democratization of economic power.
1067 1067 The entire university should be proud of this accomplishment,.
1070 1070 Patients can certainly get better with these bone marrow transplants, but it requires finding a matched donor and even with a match, there are risks,.
1071 1071 We did not expect the virus to spread so rapidly and so widely throughout the globe. Considering such a wide spread of the virus, the country 's economic growth may be expected to fall short of the earlier estimate,.
1072 1072 And taxpayers are n't just dreamin' to believe that California can produce a full record too.
1073 1073 As the president has stressed several times, people should already now be feeling real changes for the better, so far this is happening far from everywhere,.

1105 1105 Consumer and business confidence could be set back for a longer period of time, causing economic growth to slow more persistently,.
1112 1112 is likely to increase substantially over the coming years.
1116 1116 some more or less stable trend can be documented,.
1119 1119 They have needs now and they borrow from loan sharks, so the solution is that we should create this fund and capitalise it to the tune of $ 100 million. We think this is a good figure and for them to benefit from borrowing, they should also contribute and we worked it out to 2,5 %. That will then allow them access to a certain level of credit, of borrowing,.
1123 1123 We need to get the credit system working smoothly in a way that will help fundamentally healthy firms survive this period. That would avoid a lot of damage to the economy,.
1125 1125 is having a significant effect on the Australian economy at present, particularly in the education and travel sectors. The uncertainty that it is creating is also likely to affect domestic spending,.
1127 1127 If the unemployment rate were to be trending in the wrong direction and there was no further progress being made towards the inflation target, the balance of arguments would change,.
1130 1130 persists for an extended period, the effect on economic activity is likely to be larger than currently projected,.
1137 1137 The reality is that 75 to 80 per cent of everything you see in a grocery store that 's been processed would have a genetic modified ingredient - and really, you ca n't tell as a consumer.
1138 1138 People will buy products they may not even need. But they do it because they feel they need to protect themselves or they feel that a precious resource ... is going to be running out. If you feel ill-prepared, you will succumb to this temptation of panicking.
1140 1140 I 'd start with lettuce, radishes, tomatoes and cucumbers. I would say those are the really easy and popular ones to grow.
1143 1143 We need economic indicators that can tell us what 's happening across the whole economy, day by day,.
1148 1148 These are what might be called ` Aha !' statistics. Other statistics which suggest opposite conclusions bring no Aha ! but are more likely to be glided over and forgotten.
1151 1151 We 'll be well into May.
1153 1153 I do n't think answer is to stop making the tidyverse better.
1156 1156 If minorities are tortured there and police failed or ca n't discharge their duties, it is a matter of serious concern. It is reported that those who died or were tortured are mostly Muslims. India is a secular country we ca n't divide Hindus and Muslims. As an Indian citizen, I ca n't help but worry.
1158 1158 We need to do what it takes to reassure people that society does care and that their minimum well-being should be secure,.
1162 1162 wage gains are still too low to prompt meaningful inflation risk, but the Dec number is an outlier [ ... ] we ca n't see why the Fed would ease if the recent payroll gains are sustained.
1163 1163 In any event, total layoffs between the March and April payroll surveys look destined to reach perhaps 16 to 20 million, consistent with the unemployment rate leaping to 13 to 16 percent. In one month.
1169 1169 In addition, a decline in commodity prices could lead to fiscal pressures for Africa 's economic power houses such as Nigeria, South Africa, Algeria, Egypt and Angola,.
1171 1171 Not only is this pandemic costing lives, but its impact on economies and living standards will likely outlive the health emergency phase. By ensuring our clients sustain their operations during this time, we hope the private sector in the developing world will be better equipped to help economies recover more quickly,.
1174 1174 This [ outbreak ] should be worse as travel bans have started early and it seems they will remain in force for a long period of time,.
1177 1177 I have, however, been saying that it should have a certain limit,.
1178 1178 Making data available with regulators, as well as making it transparent to the public, can lead to improved environmental performance of industrial units concerned. Transparency and disclosure initiatives have been common in the United States, with the Toxic Release Inventory being the most prominent.
1182 1182 Destroy work and, in the end, working-class life can not survive. It is the loss of meaning, of dignity, of pride, and of self-respect that comes with the loss of marriage and of community that brings on despair, not just or even primarily the loss of money.
1187 1187 shutting down markets during a crash never helps -- rather it only compounds investors' pains. As scary as the losses may seem on paper, as long as the markets stay open, investors always know they can get out. Take away their exit and you exacerbate their fears.
1190 1190 Although three months' worth of progress may sound comparatively small to some people, it equates to more than 10 percent of the three academic secondary school years measured -- from when these young people are aged 11 years old to 14, which we know is a hugely developmental period,.
1192 1192 If I want to save money for my retirement or start a business or buy a house or whatever, it 's about connecting people from A to B. From that vantage point, what we really want is a small financial sector.
1198 1198 I ( can ) assure that ( the ) Sudanese armed forces and other regular forces have the capacity to handle the situation,.
1200 1200 I have been clear that our farmers, crofters and land managers are part of the climate solution. But equally, I am clear that achieving our legally binding commitments will require everyone to consider what they can do to ensure they play their part in driving the sector towards a low carbon, sustainable future.
1201 1201 That ship sailed into a well forecasted storm and had a very predictable and what could 've been entirely avoidable,.
1202 1202 If the labor market is too loose, this is going to generate deflation. Depending on how you weigh what 's going on in the labor market versus what 's happening to inflation, that sort of informs your opinions on how you want to adjust interest rates and what the potential consequences are.
1206 1206 We 're trying to systematize this knowledge so that other people can teach courses in it,.
1208 1208 can throw a hissy fit and throw themselves onto the ground and cry and scream.
1211 1211 I do not have any other job apart from football. It is not easy in Africa to develop as a footballer but if you chose to play it becomes easy. One has to work hard, respect teammates and take advice from the right people,.
1216 1216 Typically, what 's happened in the past, there may be a short-term impact of an epidemic or a pandemic, but longer term it seems to have relatively little influence, and I think many observers are hoping that will be true this time,.
1217 1217 Longer-term, it seems to have relatively little influence, and I think many observers are hoping that will be true this time,.
1222 1222 The review is going to be very broad, and it could include the tools and communications.
1223 1223 The coronavirus is an economic and financial shock. The extent of that shock still needs to be assessed, but it could provide the spark for an arguably long-overdue adjustment in the capital markets,.
1225 1225 We appreciate that regulators and agencies have an obligation to investigate ; if any information is sought from us, as a responsible corporate citizen, we will of course provide the same,.
1229 1229 What would be most visible is the effect on cellphones and other wireless devices, as well as TVs, computers, those sorts of things are almost certainly going to be affected,.
1230 1230 Certainly, if it turns out to be a containable epidemic, if it turns out that the effects can be contained within the first quarter in terms of economic activity, then maybe financial markets will be proven right,.
1231 1231 Epidemic would not sow panic in a robust economy.
1235 1235 must continue to throw the kitchen sink of unconventional measures at the crisis,.
1236 1236 They can not go without a paycheck. They do not have money in a savings account that will let them pay their rent if they do n't work for a couple of weeks. They have no way to cope with this,.
1237 1237 We had games where they had the opportunity to be nasty to each other, but I think people respond really well to warmth and friendliness. Where the grit from our format is that although people can be really nice to each other, in the room we can get inside their thought process and we can hear perhaps their thoughts are slightly more nuanced towards a person than they are promoting,.
1243 1243 A huge question surrounding the 2020 presidential campaign is whether Democratic blue-collar voters are going to buy [ the Democrats' ] policy mix any more than they did in 2016, and, of course, Trump won a lot of those voters [ in 2016 ], and that 's largely why he 's in office.
1247 1247 The role of international election observers need to be redefined or they need to send people who can observe the election. We will not welcome election tourists here,.
1248 1248 I can not speak for DPP. Let them speak for their party,.
1249 1249 unions, insurance companies and other organizations play a role in providing social protections. These arrangements already show signs of adapting to the changing world of work in the information era, a positive development that should be encouraged.
1250 1250 will implode and could lead to a crisis bigger than 2009,.
1252 1252 If [ Sanders' plan ] is funded in a very efficient way, it could lead to positive economic growth, despite its price tag.
1253 1253 If the UK economy is to take advantage of the opportunities that are opening up, SMEs will be a central part of the picture,.
1259 1259 If we were to see a recession at some point in the next few years, with interest rates close to where they are now, then you would only have 150 basis points or so for conventional interest rate cuts -- that 's only about a third of the typical reduction in short-term rates,.
1266 1266 But it was far from optimal then and would be even further from optimal now.
1276 1276 Igor Dodon, who is trying to take over Plahotniuc 's corrupt system, must remember -- sooner or later, those who commit crimes against their own people will be punished,.
1278 1278 Even if this does n't work, at least I tried.
1285 1285 A smoking gun of sorts : an actual example of literal hard-ass words ... this document seemed to contain verbatim boss-words -- the actual substance of the theoretical charisma.
1288 1288 RNA interference is like a vaccination -- it triggers a natural and highly specific mechanism whereby specific targets are suppressed, be they the RNA of viruses or endogenous genes,.
1289 1289 Thank goodness it was well before social media as well or that would have been out forever.
1290 1290 What could be one of the biggest divorce settlements in British history.
1294 1294 It 's a good idea to set aside some money and gradually buy in. Do n't put everything in at the same time but gradually put in 10 percent of your cash to be buying. It all depends upon valuations. The valuations are extremely good then there 's no reason why you should n't be buying. In situations like this, usually you see the recovery will be very fast. So, I do n't think you 're going to see a very big situation over here of long, long low market prices,.
1295 1295 I do n't think the RBI had much choice but to act the way it did.
1297 1297 Their knee-jerk response is that they hate the shift so much they think we should just get rid of it,.
1305 1305 I think it is critical that we act that way.
1312 1312 We want to make a big difference in our community and that 's why we increased our charitable fund and created the multi-year awards, so we can have a longer lasting impact.
1313 1313 IT sector of Punjab depends upon knowledge economy and a proper ecosystem should be there to cater a huger talent in this sector.
1323 1323 And the supermarket 's plan is not the same as yours. And the supermarket controls the environment, so who do you think wins ?.
1324 1324 If we 're spending trillions, I do n't understand why we 're not throwing hundreds of billions at the things we need to stop the spread.
1327 1327 There 's a prevailing notion that carbon pricing may affect the competitiveness of facilities within a state, but the question is just how much ?.
1329 1329 My wife is not here, so I can say it. That 's the way it is for most of the participants.
1330 1330 so, so disruptive that anything that you can do to mitigate that destructive impact of the pandemic itself is going to be useful.
1334 1334 I think bondholders today, if you give them a way out, they will be happy,.
1336 1336 No question that officials and politicians, even Republicans in the Senate, are prepared to abandon old shibboleths like ` government should keep its hands off the private sector,.
1337 1337 That may reflect that the nature of the relationship of financial markets and the economy changes over time, possibly from the effect of monetary policy or financial innovations, and you can not rely on it for forecasts.
1338 1338 The long-term rate in Australia has little impact on private sector activity as just about all the funding of the Australian economy occurs at floating [ short ] rates or on very short-term fixed rates,.
1339 1339 There was a time when Dr. Doom Fauci 's prediction of mass death would have opened the markets down 1000. Has Chicken Little lost his mojo ?.
1340 1340 It read ` I 'm Deaf' on the front and ` tap on the shoulder' on the back which is exactly what I needed people to know from a distance so I can do my job,.
1343 1343 We are in total isolation to keep us both safe as possible, so my husband must report to work and make necessary runs for provisions,.
1344 1344 With rates at the zero bound, and the Fed adamant that it does not want negative rates, what 's left is more QE, or an explicit policy of yield caps.
1346 1346 The 13.4 % increase in confirmed US cases yesterday was the smallest yet, though increases at this pace would still generate 1mln cases by April 12. Daily case growth needs to slow much further before any sort of control in the absolute numbers can be achieved,.
1347 1347 If so, we doubt it can last as labor shortages become more acute.
1349 1349 But MBS has a big advantage : He can treat his country as his personal property. This might be the point where Putin 's calculations went wrong.
1355 1355 So let 's say for this quarter, very likely there would be some negative impact. What would happen beyond this quarter, we have to just observe and assess,.
1357 1357 it seems Bulgarian would soon be spoken in my hall where eurozone meetings take place.
1358 1358 Think of how stranded assets [ such as now-unviable coal-fired power stations or coal mines ] can trigger unexpected loss,.
1361 1361 Even as we move through this containment phase, we must plan for recovery,.
1362 1362 While many countries recognize the need for gender equality and women 's empowerment, governments can use gender budgeting to structure spending and taxation in ways to advance gender equality even further -- increasing women 's participation in the workforce and, in turn, boosting growth and stability,.
1366 1366 The CAD1.3400-CAD1.3450 area has blocked stronger US dollar gains over the past six months. The Canadian dollar may be quick to recover when the fear and anxiety breaks.
1367 1367 An economic tsunami has been unleashed. A consensus appears to be emerging among economists of the largest contraction in global GDP in a generation,.
1372 1372 By focussing purely on his white-ball game, we believe Alex can become a really consistent match-winner for Kent.
1375 1375 Areas that are relatively unaffordable or declining in affordability are starting to experience slower job growth,.
1378 1378 If there 's insufficient supply, that means prices will continue to rise strongly, and at some point it 's going to choke off potential buyers as it makes it a less attractive place to live.
1382 1382 It is the only technology which can marry the fossil fuels we have -- oil, gas, others -- and our climate goals.
1388 1388 Even with output cuts equivalent of 10 % of global supply, oil inventories would still rise by 15 million bpd in the second quarter.
1395 1395 This defensive exercise demonstrates the ability to rapidly move a large force from the United States to Europe to help protect its NATO Allies if needed.
1397 1397 I will not go into details about our intelligence but what I can say is we have no reason to not believe the reports we have seen from different NATO allied capitals,.
1402 1402 Now yes, some industries may be able to find some sort of alternative supplier like in Mexico or East Europe, but that will require even more time, because not only production needs to be moved, but also the infrastructure related to logistics would need to be built.
1405 1405 We host major events of all shapes and colours in Victoria and it 's fantastic that we can be a leader in esports,.
1409 1409 [ I ] f this were going to last just that long, $ 1 trillion might be enough. But really it 's only a down payment.
1412 1412 Tom Bernthal, you are my everything. I could not love you more.
1417 1417 We 've heard loud and clear that financial support could enable them to keep the lights on and pay people who ca n't come to work.
1425 1425 If they pass, then they will graduate. If not, then we will provide them the needed intervention,.
1428 1428 The Maryland General Assembly needs to do as much as we can to stop making incarceration a scarlet letter that prevents people from getting a job, from going to work, from taking care of their kids,.
1429 1429 Had I known this information, I think there would have been much more targeted and purposeful questions about the necessity of projects that appear to have a financial benefit to the governor.
1434 1434 even though the numbers of cases on the continent are quite small. If you look at that Africa does not seem to be affected. But then when you look at the economics, I think that is where the big story is for Africa. We are being severely affected.
1440 1440 We do n't want to lose investment that we should otherwise get because of hurdle rates that are too high,.
1445 1445 These approvals are also short term and can be revoked when the crisis is over,.
1448 1448 The rise in bandwidth per user is also positive, as it should be resulting in a better experience for broadband consumers.
1452 1452 If you look at the stronger economy -- and there ( are ) some pretty strong growth assumptions in the budget, maybe higher than I would want to go now -- but with those strong growth assumptions, you get lots of people off of food stamps, people out of welfare.
1453 1453 While we will very likely have a global recession, it wo n't be an enduring one.
1454 1454 we do n't know we can contain [ coronavirus ] in that manner.
1456 1456 Let 's just say it : The longest economic expansion in U.S. history may already be over, killed by Covid-19.
1462 1462 There is a proliferation of armed groups but I think our peace architecture will respond to that in a very positive way,.
1465 1465 Since our offices and machinery are shut these days and staff is not coming to work, we can not share any AQI values. Several people have been sharing pictures of the view from their places with me since morning and it surely is a rare view because of cleaner air.
1466 1466 The PM and the home minister are only indulging in statements and counter-statements, claims and counter-claims. Congress wants that meaningful political activities should be initiated in J & K at the earliest. This political tourism of taking the ambassadors on guided tour of J & K should be stopped. This is our demand in the context of J & K,.
1479 1479 It is the merit that keeps the state alive. If you break the merit in the state, the state begins to rot,.
1480 1480 All Latter Day Saints believe that Jesus is going to come back at some point, that there will be a second coming of Christ, but the idea that anyone knows what that date is, or that they have to take specific extreme actions in preparation, that would go way beyond mainstream teaching,.
1481 1481 We all should emulate this as we move forward in our careers.
1482 1482 Whenever something like this hits, whenever an epidemic or pandemic hit, a lot of times it 's just devastating.
1485 1485 distressing personal stories about being forced into work or lacking protection in their workplace.
1490 1490 In a world of low real rates, there 's also a strong case for programs to invest in infrastructure, education, research and development, climate change mitigation -- namely investments that would elevate potential growth.
1491 1491 It is just conceivable that it could throw the United States into a recession,.
1494 1494 We 're a team that 's building. I do n't know why he would want to come to the Dolphins. He 's the fiercest competitor. He 's a winner. We 're at a stage with the Dolphins where we 're trying to build a team for the future.
1505 1505 begin to understand why did they do these horrible things and in a sense how can we prevent that from happening again ?.

1508 1508 As these things fade deeper into history, people who are trying to destroy the truth of the Holocaust may begin to find it easier.
1509 1509 With the global goals, which point out who should do what, we have access to both the private and the public sector, and thus can benefit from the synergies that exist between climate, health and justice. For example, speed connects to clean air, climate and security,.
1514 1514 one of the few areas in which tech unicorns have appeared that have employed less-skilled Americans. Inevitably, they 're not getting them at blue-chip salaries,.
1515 1515 Basically we 've put the economy into hibernation because we think it 's the right thing to do for public health,.
1517 1517 But in the post-coronavirus world, it should be a thriving business again. What that burrito business needs is what every business needs right now -- a time machine to go from the present pandemic to the future.
1524 1524 I 'm not here to suggest he always behaved well,.
1528 1528 it is still too soon to even speculate about either the size or the persistence of these effects, or whether they will lead to a material change in the outlook.
1529 1529 Demand is impacted very adversely. On net it is disinflationary. I do n't think it is deflationary. I think we have the tools to keep the economy out of deflation,.

1531 1531 It is very likely that the global economy will witness its worst recession since the Great Depression this year, exceeding what it witnessed during the global financial crisis a decade ago.
1533 1533 preliminary signs that the decline in manufacturing and trade may be bottoming out.
1534 1534 Inflation expectations remain aligned with the central bank 's target and short-term real rates are above the historical average. This context suggests that the current policy rate is appropriate. The MPC should remain cautious as inflationary pressures could re-emerge and a relatively tight stance may help stabilize the exchange rate and reduce FX interventions,.
1536 1536 Governments could offer temporary and targeted credit guarantees for the near-term liquidity needs of these firms. Financial market regulators and supervisors could also encourage, on a temporary and time-bound basis, extensions of loan maturities.
1537 1537 export dependent economies like Germany should benefit from improvements in external demand.
1542 1542 Absolutely, some of the practices that we 've been following the last few decades are just not sustainable but you need to give it time so the economics can follow or else you 're just going to disenfranchise a lot of people who just ca n't afford it.
1543 1543 Our study shows the possible costs that can be avoided through global cooperative investment in public health in all countries,.
1547 1547 I will file a PIL saying that there is no public interest in this privatisation. My objection is that the nation needs Air India for several purposes and not just for commercial reasons. The whole concept of the public sector is not what government should or should not run. We are a welfare state, not a capitalist state.
1548 1548 ... if they have changed name of accused from Muslim in real life to a Hindu name. That is defamation.
1554 1554 What happens if there is a restriction on travel ; or, is this going to result in job cuts, job losses, [ or ] reduced hours, and how will that impact the income side of my cash flow, let alone the expenses,.
1560 1560 One of the benefits of England having a very data driven system is that almost all Year 11 students will have taken either mock exams or standardised tests, and schools could be asked to justify the predicted grades that they assign kids based upon such information, and even try to do some moderation where necessary.
1564 1564 And so I 've said for years since then, you do not drive a car with mud on the windshield, you should not run a company or a country with mud on your windshield.
1567 1567 home isolation of suspect cases, home quarantine of those living in the same household as suspect cases, and social distancing of the elderly and others at most risk of severe disease.
1570 1570 A strong commitment by Fed officials to do whatever is needed to accommodate dollar demand, and thereby prevent any persistent decline in overall spending, will ultimately help allay panic more than any single rate cut can.
1571 1571 For some days, markets have been expecting a deeper cut than that. Consequently, had the Fed not announced a cut the decision would have amounted to disappointing news, which would have fueled further panic.
1574 1574 I told them that while my view on securities purchases differed from theirs, I would do my best to accommodate their preferences. ` My position as Chairman is untenable if I do n't have the support of the Board,' I told them.
1579 1579 Without a doubt, the government should be a digital platform that 's created for people. That 's what we tried to do with the tax system,.
1580 1580 90 % likely to be a technical prime minister who will have no political ambitions of his own,.
1586 1586 could prove large and sharp, but should be temporary.
1587 1587 now it can be part of the solution.
1591 1591 There are downside risks from global growth and the possibility that uncertainties over future trading relationships could remain entrenched. With the relatively limited space to cut Bank Rate, if evidence builds that the weakness in activity could persist, risk management considerations would favour a relatively prompt response.
1592 1592 Doing so could turn an existential risk ... into the greatest commercial opportunity of our time.
1600 1600 I would n't be the only one.
1602 1602 It 's tradition, get bladdered at weekend. Was supposed to be on a stag do to Lisbon. But looks like getting bladdered in town instead,.
1609 1609 It 's quite likely we 're going to be in this world of low interest rates for years, perhaps decades, because it 's driven by structural factors in the global economy,.
1610 1610 I think we 'll see Chinese stimulus. That will be good for us and we 'll return to that gradually improving trend we looked like we were on before the virus.
1611 1611 interruption of the Chinese economy in the short-term may be greater,.
1613 1613 The uncertainty that it is creating is also likely to affect domestic spending,.
1615 1615 The economic tsunami that hit China and much of Asia earlier in the year and hit Europe a few weeks ago is now slamming the US economy as more parts of the country require nonessential businesses to shut down. This sudden stop in the economy is unprecedented. The only analogue is the 9/11 terrorist attack. But that lasted for a day or two, and except for airlines, businesses continued to operate,.
1616 1616 When winter does n't strike, the data can become weird.
1619 1619 It will likely show up in somewhat higher claims for unemployment insurance by late this month.
1623 1623 The interest rate move this week is intended to address exactly that. It should help stabilize housing instead of pour extra fuel on a hot housing market.
1627 1627 Some of those downside risks have clearly landed and they 've crystallized ... now we 're assessing how big they actually are and whether they will continue to get bigger, or last longer, than we 're supposing. So in that context the sense of whether we need an easing of monetary conditions is obviously present in the analysis, but the trade offs are not as simple as it sounds in a mechanical way.
1628 1628 I 'm thinking of it that way because it kind of gives me a clue of the sorts of things we could try to do to at least begin to address the affordability problem. We will not address it by wishing it away, or somehow building more houses.
1633 1633 Monetary policy can not resolve this.
1635 1635 If you can, consider buying gift certificates or prepaying for services to the restaurants, bars, and other physical businesses you normally frequent. It 's like a no-interest loan to them and can help stem the revenue loss.
1636 1636 These are extraordinary times, and we must take bold and decisive actions to save and protect millions of lives in Africa. We are in a race to save lives. No country will be left behind,.
1641 1641 To be very clear, none of us who 's been advocating for tiny house villages ... think that this is a replacement for permanent housing,.
1644 1644 It would be criminal to allow landlords to carry out rent increases during this pandemic, leading to further evictions and putting public welfare and health at grave risk.
1645 1645 We know that big business, the wealthy, and the political establishment will staunchly oppose this, and that we will need a powerful movement. If we win, this will not only transform the lives of Seattle 's working people, it will set a historical marker for cities around the nation.
1646 1646 While there can be no room for complacency, it is important to stress that NI 's health service is well-prepared and used to managing infections. We are working and liaising closely with colleagues in Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland and that co-operation will continue.
1647 1647 has brought us uncomfortably close to animals and plants that harbor diseases that can jump to humans.
1648 1648 Much of that medical waste will happen in countries that may not have had that amount of medical waste before and will not have treatment for incineration.
1651 1651 It 's largely inconsequential. The bottom line is this is a health issue. People are going to be surprised how little the economic incentives and plans are going to help until we start to see a change in the infection and death rate and I would take a 5 % improvement in the war against the coronavirus over a 100 % move in terms of economic incentives and initiatives.
1652 1652 Once you isolate patients, you put them in a negative pressure room in a hospital so that nothing can come out. And you keep them there until you 're convinced that they have lost an infection,.
1657 1657 calls for the Fed and other central banks to act quickly are misplaced at best and more likely downright dangerous.
1662 1662 We did talk about Alex, who [ was ] a lemon-lime [ soda ] addict, is probably a drug addict,.
1665 1665 The PBOC, which is not independent, will not, however, ` coordinate' with the Fed or other central banks,.
1667 1667 We do not want the next generations to inherit a world, which becomes ever more hostile and ever less habitable-just think of the wildfires in Australia,.
1677 1677 During this accelerated transformation, we must manage our operating budget with care,.
1678 1678 I also think that the health sector will see huge growth -- more doctors, more nurses, more pharmaceuticals and more medical research. Nations that gear themselves better for this will do well and by the same argument, others will do worse,.
1680 1680 Violent threats must have no place in politics for all parties.
1681 1681 But it is a concern to me that there has been, thus far, no similar condemnation or sense of regret expressed by the national party.
1682 1682 I understand they are trying to lift growth, but I think their policies undermine what they are trying to do.
1694 1694 What worries me probably more -- the sort of of perception you know, especially in financial markets, that central banks always have to react,.
1695 1695 While it 's true the crisis is n't over for China, ( there are ) lessons that can be learned from China,.
1696 1696 For long-term investors in particular these are the types of scenarios you should be running and looking at how it affects markets and businesses,.
1698 1698 the impact would not be severe.
1700 1700 There are so many words in marketing to extract the correct reaction from a buyer so they want your home. If you add too much fluff or use words that are not accurate, the buyer 's expectations are not met.
1701 1701 There was little evidence of an approaching downturn as recently as a month or two ago,.
1709 1709 It looks like almost every criminal sketch of any garden-variety black suspect.
1710 1710 It 's a situation that these programs never expected that they would find themselves in. But here we are.
1714 1714 Yes, there are members of the Russian security services working out of the Russian embassy under diplomatic cover. What the government seems to be missing is the fact that there are all sorts of informal espionage networks.
1716 1716 We 've been in lots of roundtables and consultations with employers and there 's clearly a need for interdisciplinary teams that can behave ethically across three different phases of IT -- the science phase, where new technologies are developed ; the engineering phase, where you build, integrate, deploy and maintain them ; and the management phase, where you have to make sure adoption fits in with business strategy. In every one of those phases, ethical issues can occur.
1717 1717 What Beijing wants above all is to control the ... way the world talks about and thinks about the Chinese Communist Party and its rule in China,.
1719 1719 People get realistic, they realise they 're not going to be the prime minister of Australia or the CEO of a company, but they 're going to be okay,.
1722 1722 The journey between Syrex and Redstor began more than two decades ago and was formalised in 2018. With Redstor, we can provide customers with a comprehensive offering that meets all the backup, business continuity, disaster recovery, and cyber security requirements of the digital business,.
1723 1723 There 's also some evidence that a person 's political identity can influence their behavior -- what they buy, where they live, who they hire. If we can understand what 's driving partisan divides, we may be able to take steps to reduce them.
1724 1724 Though we do not agree with the Supreme Court, which seems to be encouraging impunity and brigandage with its pronouncements, but in keeping to our democratic disposition as law-abiding citizens, we have accepted the judgment with equanimity, devoid of anger and bitterness. We also urge Abians to accept the temporary setback, remain peaceful and law-abiding.
1725 1725 would be established in each state.
1726 1726 A recent erroneous online message circulating in several languages around the world and purporting to be a Unicef communication appears to indicate, among other things, that avoiding ice cream and other cold foods can help prevent the onset of the disease. This is, of course, wholly untrue,.
1728 1728 I know of ( prosecutors ) that would never file the death penalty because they do n't believe in it,.
1734 1734 The agreement is just a kind of framework. You can not take the chance to raise prices arbitrarily or sell inferior quality products to China -- that would certainly not be acceptable for local companies and consumers. The framework is based on the principles of the market economy.
1736 1736 The question is whether it pushes firms so far that they go out of business or start laying employees off,.
1741 1741 So in good times and bad, we must stick with each other.
1744 1744 ... we could afford to use our resources profligately,.
1748 1748 This is similar to, but somewhat more generous than, what President Bush did in 2008. Back then, electronic deposits were made available within three months. Some consumers might spend the money right away to meet rent if they lose their regular paycheck ; others might have stronger balance sheets and spend the money at whatever uncertain date the virus is contained,.
1749 1749 We can take this further, these concepts, too.
1750 1750 What I think stands out about her beyond her skills is her character. She is a great teammate, incredibly modest and she has been a huge part of our program and obviously we are sad to see her go.
1753 1753 While some firms think about technology merely as a different type of capital investment that does not impact their way of doing things, others are adopting new technologies as they make significant changes to the customers they serve, the skills they employ, and their organizational structures. The latter approach involves higher costs and time horizons, but most likely also much higher returns.
1764 1764 Keeping a constituency informed and involved is important but it 's not really what I would see as their primary mission,.
1769 1769 Taking a longer-term view, ... the easing of global financial conditions so late in the economic cycle and the continued buildup of financial vulnerabilities -- including the rise in asset valuations to stretched levels in some markets and countries, the rise in debt, and large capital flows to emerging markets -- could threaten growth in the medium term,.
1775 1775 Maybe a partial lifting of the shelter-in-place for those less vulnerable may make some sense, in about three weeks. By then, much of the damage will have been done,.
1778 1778 Any business that is necessary for public safety should not have an interruption in their operations,.
1780 1780 I think it is fair to say that the tax increase -- assuming it is as big as Senator Sanders projects -- is about as large as the [ 13-point ] tax increases enacted to finance World War II,.
1791 1791 The Trump administration also weakened a portion of the EPA rule that would have required the chemical industry to consider whether alternative chemicals or processes could reduce the consequences of a chemical safety accident,.
1793 1793 Countries in East Asia and the Pacific and elsewhere must fight this disease together, keep trade open and coordinate macroeconomic policy,.
1794 1794 If each country imposes restrictions, then the global price increases even more than it would have. And it can end up being a self-defeating policy,.
1798 1798 The BOJ ... wo n't hesitate to take additional easing steps if there is a greater possibility that the momentum toward achieving its 2 % price target will be lost,.
1801 1801 Read what the definition of a pandemic is versus an epidemic. Forty to 70 % of the world 's population will be affected in some way by this situation. If that 's the case, and I do n't mean to be a doomsayer, I think that the global implications of all of these shutdowns and all these interruptions are potentially huge.
1805 1805 Climate policy affecting oilsands could not be clearer,.
1809 1809 If we do get a slowing of growth, the size of the market [ for distress ] could be gigantic.
1811 1811 I think it 's a game we can look at to win,.
1812 1812 No one can know for certain how long Madoff will live ; however, while he could live longer than 18 months, he could also die before that time,.
1813 1813 Russian economic growth can rise from last year 's 1.3 % to 2 % or so, although it 's not really going to go much higher without major structural changes. It 's not particularly radical. It 's based on market forces.
1814 1814 Too many people think that if you want to take your own life you will, and the means do n't matter. But a gun in the home increases the chance of suicide probably threefold,.
1817 1817 Liquidity wise, we should be fine, we just have to go through this as quickly as possible, containing it and of course repressing the population from moving,.
1819 1819 If I do n't make four albums then what am I really doing in the studio every day ?.
1832 1832 If uncertainty over the future trading arrangement or subdued global growth continue to weigh on demand, then my inclination is towards voting for a cut in Bank rate in the near term,.
1841 1841 If we can get more produced in the south, that will save $ 2 to $ 3 per gigajoule, and that 's a life-or-death-difference for many industries.
1842 1842 We note that some magazine titles have already closed, and others are likely to follow, regardless of this deal.
1843 1843 We do n't want to damage the structure of the economy, so that when the health crisis is over, we can rise up and be ready to go. So we do n't want the sort of structural change that might be being suggested by Mr Joyce.
1853 1853 Why would any president reject that ?.
1854 1854 So, rather than starting a conversation about how we can work together to improve and build upon this monumental environmental law, what starts now is our fight to save it.
1857 1857 Example of China recovery shows supply side is working ; people not going out much, so demand side may be slower coming back than supply-side.
1861 1861 The Governor intends to speak to the measures the Bank has taken to ensure the financial system has sufficient liquidity so that credit continues to be available to businesses and households. He will not be announcing any new measures or actions,.
1863 1863 Historically, they would have met the definition of currency manipulator 15 years ago.
1864 1864 I think BI has already done the bulk of the growth-supporting measures ... BI will still be accommodative. It 's just not necessarily through interest rates,.
1869 1869 I think it might be a false dichotomy because we do n't have a very good understanding of what the impact of a severe [ economic ] depression would be on human life,.
1876 1876 They cited adverse intelligence reports and asked us to call off the programme ... It seems the ruling establishment does not want us to organise any programme to oppose the NRC and the CAA,.
1877 1877 Religious discrimination could turn into other rights violations. What happens to the 19 lakh people already declared non-citizens in Assam,.
1878 1878 The findings suggest that schools may be a particularly important setting for the prevention of future crime. Many high-risk youth in the sample drop out of school at a very young age and are incarcerated for serious crimes prior to the age of high school graduation. For these youth on the margins of society, public schools may present the best opportunity to intervene.
1879 1879 Whether that is an ongoing turning point remains to be seen,.
1883 1883 Wan na clear a few things up Oasis gig for NHS charity, as in all money raised goes to NHS not to me, will happen with or without Noel Gallagher it may not be the same but trust me it 'll still blow you knickers off as you were LG x.
1884 1884 Give a s * * t what people think I 'm crying I 'm sad this has all brought it home how much I miss and need him for love. ( sic ).
1885 1885 Being in a band-it was about the Roses, it was about The Beatles or The Stones or The Pistols.
1891 1891 Ideally we want to have our pets in our home, but sometimes there are cases when the animal is n't suited to be in the home or actually sometimes they prefer to be outside,.
1897 1897 We 've heard loud and clear that financial support could enable them to keep the lights on and pay people who ca n't come to work. That 's why today I 'm announcing that Facebook is investing $ 100 million to help 30,000 small businesses in over 30 countries where our employees live and work.
1910 1910 whether it will withstand legal scrutiny is doubtful because granting citizenship is a central subject.
1912 1912 There were two Menons out there, Patel 's key advisor was VP Menon and Nehru 's key advisor was Krishna Menon. Krishna Menon did not like V P Menon and the feeling was mutual. Mountbatten used to get along with both. V P Menon would meet Mountbatten to tell him what Patel thought and Krishna Menon would meet him to tell him what Nehru thought,.
1916 1916 Now it [ the new virus ] has been added to the list of especially dangerous illnesses. That will allow us to deport foreign citizens if they are diagnosed with such an illness,.
1917 1917 I want us to think about how to justify the confidence of the president, of our people at all stages of our activities,.
1925 1925 There are preliminary signs that the decline in manufacturing and trade may be bottoming out. This is partly from an improvement in the auto sector as disruptions from new emission standards start to fade,.
1930 1930 the financial system was the core of the problem then, and there is no reason for this shock to turn into the experience of 2008 if we handle it well.
1931 1931 could prove large but will ultimately be temporary.
1940 1940 One last thing I would like to say, and this is to Senator Bernie Sanders : Bernie do n't drop out. Do n't endorse Joe Biden.
1942 1942 Oxytocin might render subjects more optimistic about the likelihood of a good outcome,.
1962 1962 Instead of parading us down your walk of shame, you should be giving us three Michelin stars. So before you come to my house and slap me in the face, get your story straight.
1966 1966 doing everything she can,.
1970 1970 the situation is evolving rapidly and we stand ready to provide a forceful, coordinated response if conditions require it. Some countries will see financing needs rise rapidly as the economic and human costs of the virus escalates.
1972 1972 The outlook for global growth for 2020 is negative, and we will have a recession at least as bad as the GFC or worse, but expect a recovery in 2021,.
1973 1973 But what would happen beyond the quarter ? We have to just observe and assess.
1975 1975 Our team is working expeditiously to respond to this request so that a proposal can be considered by the IMF 's executive board as soon as possible,.
1979 1979 What we 're doing right now is reviewing country by country what are the financial needs, and engaging with these countries to make sure they are aware of this resource and we can immediately respond to them. We 're in an early stage of engagement, but I can assure you that we will act very quickly as requests come.
1981 1981 The merged entity would need to be authorized also, say, in the U.S., Japan, China if it wants to compete globally.
1986 1986 This is a piece of about wish fulfillment and wondering what if there was this band of secret Nazi hunters who were eliminating these people [ in the United States ],.
1987 1987 For this show about a group of vigilantes who try and reclaim the power, the question the show poses is : ` If you hunt monsters, do you risk becoming a monster yourself ?'.
1988 1988 takes the point of view that symbolic representations provide individuals access to an emotional and symbolic reality that allows us to better understand the experiences of the Shoah and provide it with meaning that can address our urgent present.
1995 1995 We want to improve kids' outcomes -- sometimes what we 're going to have to do is look outside of the schoolhouse door and think about housing.
1996 1996 We wanted people from lots of different backgrounds. Other reality shows, whether it 's ` Real Housewives' or ` Jersey Shore,' they 're all one gang of quite similar characters. What ` The Circle' gave us the opportunity to do was cast a very diverse net across the United States,.
1997 1997 this might be the moment when we decouple a bit from Chinese dependence, to the benefit of both countries.
1998 1998 Can you imagine, with all of the bad press they have been getting over the past 18 months if they traded their number one asset in Baez ? No way they are doing that.
2001 2001 Our baseline outlook for the global economy is increasingly pessimistic. Still, given how quickly events are moving and the high degree of uncertainty around the virus' path, it may not be pessimistic enough,.
2013 2013 Here let me be quick to say, if care is not taken, we may be heading to the IMF again for a new substantive programme, likely within context of the calls for debt forgiveness for nations like Ghana, taking account of the damage COVID 19 has done.
2017 2017 Some companies wo n't need to borrow more, some companies may need to borrow more, but no company will stay unaffected by the energy transition.
2019 2019 I raised this idea with Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdul Aziz bin Salman because Saudi Arabia has been a stabilizing factor in the market for many years, and I was hopeful that Saudi would agree with this suggestion, as well as the other 19 G20 countries,.
2020 2020 working with many countries around the world that would boost economic recovery and accelerate the energy transition.
2023 2023 I think our policy is well-calibrated to where we are ... including the risks that are out there.
2024 2024 We have to be open to the possibility that the markets' view may be more in alignment with fundamentals than the policymakers' view.
2025 2025 If this does n't have all the alarm bells ringing at the Fed, it 's hard to know what would,.
2033 2033 This is better than we expected ; it appears that firms have responded immediately, and positively, to the news that the Phase One trade deal would prevent the imposition of further tariffs on consumer goods,.
2034 2034 It 's not low enough to suggest that the Fed needs to ease but it 's a long way from suggesting they need to tighten,.
2036 2036 If these numbers are correct, though, and are sustained and then confirmed by the deaths data, they will mark the beginning of the turning point in Europe 's battle against the virus.
2037 2037 Our community hospital coupled a suite of virtual reality experiences -- which can reduce apprehension and panic during withdrawal -- with a traditional medication-assisted detox program for patients suffering from substance abuse. We 've used the latter for many years, but the VR component adds soothing imagery and sounds and leverages proven psychological techniques to make the process easier,.
2038 2038 People kinda equate economics with business, so they kinda think if you study economics you 're trying to game the system or make it in the system,.
2041 2041 Spillovers from heightened stress in Italy would be global and significant,.
2043 2043 I could see that as some factor,.
2047 2047 We look forward to that happening and we anticipate that within days we will have another meeting, possibly with members of UEFA, and then finally, if we do make substantial progress, we will hopefully have a meeting with all the stakeholders together.
2049 2049 Without some immediate response, the industry estimates that thousands of jobs could be lost within weeks. This is a desperate situation,.
2056 2056 I think that we 're seeing climate change affect patterns of production and distribution and investment. We 're seeing the cost and availability of insurance change, which is going to affect where people invest,.
2063 2063 It did n't matter so much who won, it was more important to try to put on a show. Whoever jumped well that day, we all were cheering for him. I think Charles Austin won the competition, but I am not sure.
2066 2066 Tomorrow, if Mike Bloomberg has not dropped out and Elizabeth Warren has n't dropped out, they have no defense for their candidacy any longer.
2067 2067 Tucker was prepared to speak truth to power, and he did so before anyone else. If you 're first, and it turns out you are correct, you earn greater popularity and influence,.
2072 2072 If everybody stayed, we 'd really have a problem with crowding.
2073 2073 It depends on what you do with legacies. If you 're breaking ties [ between applicants ], is that really the end of the world ?.
2083 2083 Lending further credence to the evidence, part of the overestimation can be related to a key methodological change, which affected the measurement of the formal manufacturing sector,.
2084 2084 It 's a good thing they 're scrutinizing the exports to make sure they 're the right quality but it 's not a good thing if they 're causing a huge delay when everybody is in a great rush,.
2085 2085 It 's been a good 10 years and his 3 years probably better than expected.
2086 2086 so the loss of household wealth and liquidity does raise the odds of a bad outcome. Consumer confidence now may be shaken more by the speed of the decline than the scale.
2091 2091 It is arbitrary that the self-employed should see the large part of their income disappear, while other workers enjoy government protection,.
2092 2092 If bosses disregard employees' wellbeing then the Government should take tougher action to force compliance.
2095 2095 Either the cup is half full or half empty. To us, that is a $ 68 - $ 108bn opportunity,.
2096 2096 What happens to kids who grew up with a mum who was addicted to OxyContin or whose dad committed suicide, or has bounced around between relatives because they do n't have a stable home life, do n't know their dads ? I think that for people whose lives were unstable as children, they 're at much higher risk for bad things happening. They 're on trajectories that are going to lead to some pretty difficult circumstances.
2100 2100 probably shrinking as we speak.
2105 2105 even if you 're not freaked out about a pandemic, you worry that everyone else is & they 'll stockpile ... & you do n't want to be the left paperless.
2106 2106 I think it 's a miscalculation from Sanders,.
2107 2107 Without legislation to require that they have protective gear, these bright lights in the labor market actually may become a dangerous temptation for an older worker who needs the income.
2108 2108 Yes, the markets are changing. Yes, competition is difficult. But if you can retain your own resources and make the necessary investments, yes, you can compete,.
2110 2110 At the time we would talk in class about Schumpeter 's idea that innovation is important for growth, but we realized that what was lacking was a model,.
2111 2111 By contrast, the coronavirus is creating a situation where, for a brief amount of time, 50 per cent or more of people may not be able to work,.
2112 2112 Every time there 's a crisis, these questions get asked : Should we become more sovereign ? Should we process more of our own food ? But nothing changes, really,.
2114 2114 There are other pieces that I think make a lot of sense, around witness intimidation.
2115 2115 Fundamentally, the idea is the ads that are served up in the state of Maryland on platforms, the revenue that is generated from the service of those ads in the state of Maryland would be subject to an excise tax,.
2121 2121 can not afford a one-and-a-half year stalemate.
2124 2124 Taking into account globalisation, the supply chain at a global level, and all the consequences of the fear that is accompanying this epidemic, or this pandemic, we see that there is a demand shock also and we have both together at the global level, and this of course is something which calls for appropriate decisions, not only by central banks of course, but by all partners, without exception.
2125 2125 The road is completely obliterated and there is no plan for it. Will people ever get to walk the track again ? You can fly and come by helicopter but most people ca n't afford that.
2126 2126 The Vice-President, Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, is a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank ; are you saying that whatever the committee will put together, he can not think and put it together ?.
2128 2128 We will be extending our feeding program for as long as we can to as many people as we can,.
2129 2129 are happy to shoot themselves in the foot, so long as they can shoot the Americans, too.
2131 2131 Organizations are seen as bigger, even if they are n't.
2132 2132 Perhaps too much emphasis has been placed on how big a dampening ( effect ) immigration has had on real pay in the first place.
2133 2133 The government jumped in to take advantage of low-interest rates while also playing it safe as it can not be sure of what the future holds.
2134 2134 The loss of revenue suffered by the private sector, and the debt contracted to reduce the deficit, must be finally absorbed, fully or in part, in the governments' statements of accounts,.
2136 2136 and why they can fail so badly.
2138 2138 Hence, the situation is not easy -- we can all see that -- but the government has an action plan that we will work on,.
2139 2139 This will further destroy small business cashflows and will mean that if and when employees return to work they will have to start from scratch,.
2142 2142 Accordingly, we are likely at an in ? ection point where ` fear' - driven purchases will begin to dominate liquidity-driven selling pressure, as it did in November 2008.
2143 2143 appears impossible at this point.
2145 2145 But these are no reasons to delay putting out a generally applicable economic medicine that would help in any downturn.
2147 2147 We should certainly be prepared for a meaningful level of deliberate suspension of economic activity for the rest of the year.
2151 2151 How would a progressive wealth tax work ? Evidence from the economics literature,.
2152 2152 If we do not deal with this discussion and research today, then in 10 years it could be too late and the opportunity will be gone.
2153 2153 Reducing fixed charges and taxes and credit forbearance would also help to reduce the pressure on firms facing an abrupt falloff in demand.
2166 2166 Any Bengali who has been persecuted for religious reasons in Bangladesh, will be welcome in our country. But it must be for religious reasons.
2167 2167 Income tax must be abolished. We must also increase the Fixed Deposit interest rates.
2169 2169 26/11 Terror Act was a ISI & UPA joint operation to launch Hindu Terror operation and ban RSS. It fizzled because a brave Policeman caught Kasab alive. All ten others were killed. They were dressed as Hindus would be,.
2170 2170 This GST is so complicated ( that ) nobody understands which form to fill where. And they wanted it to be uploaded to the computer. Somebody came from Rajasthan, Barmer ... He said we dont have electricity, how can we upload ? So I said upload it on your head and go to the Prime Minister and tell him.
2172 2172 The government has been very patient. I would have lifted them to Tughlakabad.
2177 2177 Forget hawks and doves -- this job needs a woodpecker, someone who 'll hammer away at the importance of stable money. The goal : not a strong dollar or a weak dollar, but a dependable dollar,.
2179 2179 I was well aware that there are much worse things I could have been facing,.
2181 2181 She works with care and thoughtfulness with each person or group that she is involved with,.
2186 2186 I personally do not think there is much to be gained from a national register. The costs and benefits of doing that need to be carefully evaluated .... There are obviously apprehensions on what impact these initiatives will have on the Muslim minority and these apprehensions must be addressed,.
2188 2188 May I urge that the proposals may be urgently put in place so that the State has some resources to fight the menace of COVID-19 and implement welfare measures for the people, especially poor farmers, the unorganized workers and micro and small enterprises, who among others, have been so badly impacted,.
2189 2189 The fact the U.S. has weak support for people falling on hard times should not be celebrated. It 's a key reason the U.S. has higher child poverty than many of our competitors.
2192 2192 assess it in the next week or so.
2193 2193 trusts the superintendent or not.
2194 2194 I think we have used all the available channels,.
2198 2198 This data was when things were going well. That means anyone who loses a job in a month 's time could go hungry,.
2200 2200 I do n't think it 's quite going to be the same in China ... but nonetheless, a terrific day for Tesla and well-deserved because they 've innovated with a product that many of us love.
2205 2205 We 've seen quite wild swings in the market, and that 's because of the massive amount of uncertainty as to whether the stimulus will get done and how long will the recovery take.
2207 2207 But, exactly what do we mean by a hotel that is hit hard ? Would my personal Airbnb not count if I had a lot of cancellations. I could see these targets being litigated and funds being dispersed well after science has figured out a solution.
2208 2208 By pushing the season ticket renewal deadline back and confirming our policy if games were to be cancelled or played behind closed doors, we want to ease any concerns our loyal fans may have in the current circumstances,.
2212 2212 RNA interference is like a vaccination-it triggers a natural and highly specific mechanism whereby specific targets are suppressed, be they the RNA of viruses or endogenous genes,.
2213 2213 That 's why you 're intervening. So they 're almost by construction going to be plagued by the issue of regression to [ ward ] the mean. I think that 's a really important lesson as we continue to try to figure out how to improve health care delivery, especially as so much of the work focuses on these high-cost patients.
2225 2225 You ca n't do this as a tick-box compliance exercise where each person signs off their little bit to say ethical concerns are sorted because when you put them all together, the system overall may not work as it 's meant to,.
2226 2226 Because of this, the virus 's impact may be quite a bit more costly than many analysts anticipate,.
2231 2231 One step teams and organizations can take is to ask former CEOs to serve as advisors when younger, leapfrogging CEOs are promoted.,.
2232 2232 You could apply for a mortgage holiday where the banks will let you pause your repayments for up to six months if your financial difficulty is due to the pandemic,.
2237 2237 The costs will probably exceed everything known from economic crises or natural disasters in Germany in recent decades,.
2238 2238 They 're going to make a deal, because they have to. They have to. They have no choice ... And I would be very surprised if I had to implement the tariffs.
2240 2240 In any kind of protest, the opposition unity is important as it makes it easier for everyone. Unity is important if the protests are happening for the right reasons,.
2244 2244 This aggression must be condemned by US and EU, and Putin must understand that only path to better West/Russia relations runs through Ukraine,.
2247 2247 Historically, anytime that we have needed to build, there was never a recession. This is an incentive for builders to start more construction. If they do, I think we will have at least 12 consecutive years of economic expansion.
2249 2249 Africa may lose half of its Gross Domestic Product with growth, falling from 3.2 percent to about 2 percent due to a number of reasons which include the disruption of global supply chains,.
2251 2251 I urge you to consider the resources available and how your Representation or Organization can contribute to the growing list of donors to FAO 's response plan for effective Desert Locust Control in the Horn of Africa. Locusts do not wait, they will go wherever they want and they will destroy anything they want. Please do not wait to act, let us work together to upscale operations and recovery efforts to safeguard livelihoods and food security in the Greater Horn of Africa,.
2253 2253 Sit still. If you sell in a panic and then buy in the upturn you are guaranteed to lose money.
2255 2255 A major agreement between the Democrats and Republicans on an infrastructure bill could change that outcome. That is a missing ingredient in the U.S. economic outlook for 2021,.
2257 2257 Presumably, there is a treaty that is in final form or maybe still just close to it.
2258 2258 We have gone through the list of lenders in that market and basically weighed what it meant in terms of either pursuing a greenfield licence or buying an existing lender,.
2259 2259 Even if they 're not creating anything, they 're going to translate into I 'm going to use this skill set.
2261 2261 ` Atlas Shrugged' is a celebration of life and happiness. Justice is unrelenting. Creative individuals and undeviating purpose and rationality achieve joy and fulfillment. Parasites who persistently avoid either purpose or reason perish as they should.
2262 2262 But it should be good news for consumers because they should be paying less.
2264 2264 If the competitor has an undiagnosed problem, age does not play a factor ; they can be affected in their 30s too,.
2271 2271 If trade, other uncertainties do n't get resolved it could lead to wholesale retrenchment among businesses.
2272 2272 My understanding is that there is no genuine shortage of most of these items, either nationally or regionally. But a more orderly way of distributing and rationing access to groceries and medical items would ensure that more consumers would end up with some amount of most of the needed items, with fewer face-to-face interactions with retail clerks and fellow consumers.
2275 2275 The back-and-forth negotiations are taking time ; however, it means there is candidness, which I think can only be helpful.
2276 2276 The reality is that even without the data, this is the one time where we can look around and say, well, first of all, everybody is at home,.
2278 2278 was a magnet for all these very talented international migrants, which was on net, probably a good thing for the city,.
2279 2279 We 're the only city in the world that hosts a Grand Slam and a Grand Prix and fans who get along to the Australian Open over the next two weeks can expect a show like no other.
2280 2280 If anyone gave you a figure they would be pulling it out of the sky.
2283 2283 The most important benefit of having the treaty is resolving the uncertainty about what would happen if NAFTA had been dumped and not replaced.
2284 2284 If we were able to calculate [ China 's ] GDP correctly, it would probably be half of the [ official ] number.
2287 2287 Personally, I think it 's been a close call, therefore it does n't take much data to swing it one way or the other -- and the next few meetings are absolutely live. I really need to see an imminent and significant improvement in the UK data to justify waiting a little bit longer.
2288 2288 The 2000 investor is the only one that has encountered two very large bear markets early in retirement of 50 per cent or more and they seem to be doing OK.
2291 2291 Also, if the markets were more competitive, the whole economy would be more dynamic,.
2292 2292 Based on $ 7 per month for $ 1000 which is stated in their website, this works out to $ 84 per year total interest. At this rate it works out to 8.4 percent simple annual interest if there are no additional fees.
2293 2293 But it [ would be ] up to every member state to decide whether they want to apply for it or not,.
2295 2295 It could theoretically be applied to almost anything,.
2298 2298 Our continued erosion of wild spaces has brought us uncomfortably close to animals and plants that harbour diseases that can jump to humans.
2299 2299 That is if you want the ` neo-liberal kernel inside Europe'.
2302 2302 It is a wild card -- I think even the experts would confirm that it 's too soon to tell,.
2303 2303 The branding exercise earlier was to find relevant differentiation between two or three competitors. We do n't live in that world anymore. We live in the world I call the world of webs, the world of networks, the world of connectivity. It 's changing the way you think about brand,.
2304 2304 As of 2025, every Bosch product will either contain artificial intelligence or will have been developed or manufactured with the help of AI.
2305 2305 But it is a concern to me that there been, thus far, no similar condemnation or sense of regret expressed by the national party. In a letter to me from the national chair in response to this issue, the strongest it said was : ` Intimidating behaviour has no place in our politics.
2306 2306 How Many Jobs Can be Done at Home ?.
2307 2307 If we do not manage the climate crisis, it will be the same.
2312 2312 A profession that is less diverse and less open to different identities is more likely to exhibit groupthink and hubris,.
2314 2314 It 's all fine to shun oil companies, but given the scale of investments needed they will probably have to be part of the solution,.
2319 2319 If I were Italian and if I saw that other countries are not willing to help Italy, I would question membership in the Union,.
2327 2327 It 's so much larger than anything we 've encountered before. I think this is going to be larger than the Great Recession. I hope it does n't last as long, but the magnitude of the shock is bigger.
2329 2329 The technological advancements we have seen mean we could decarbonise the economy very cheaply if we choose to,.
2333 2333 We know in economics bad money drives out good money, it is not surprising that even the US dollar is now in short supply ... I would say the immediate course of action will be to remove the bond note, let the US dollar be the core currency of focus,.
2346 2346 Whether I 'm involved or indirectly involved, I screw things up all the time. The most important thing is if you do n't get it right, you 've got ta fix it immediately and I 'm proud of the way the organization said, ` You know what ? We did n't have it right and we 're going to get it right.'.
2358 2358 It was an eerie atmosphere outside. Inside, the fear was real, but you would n't have known it. There were about 60 -- 80 animals including a goldfish in a bowl. The animals were all very quiet. They seemed to be keeping the people calm and as the people patted the pets, the animals stayed calm. There is something to be said about the benefits for both,.
2359 2359 We are only suggesting to move away from that if we can replicate that richness of data but to do so it has to have two things going for it,.
2362 2362 You are eligible for these benefits. It 's extremely important, not just for you and your family, but if there 's an avalanche of people who then ca n't pay their rent, ca n't pay their mortgage, ca n't pay their car payments, that creates even worse ripple effects in the economy that makes this crisis even more so.
2365 2365 Cheetah is a flagship species of a highly endangered ecosystem of the country -- the grasslands. Cheetah is also the only species to go extinct in peninsular India in historical times. I 'd say that we could not save the cheetah earlier, but if we allow any other species to go extinct now, it will be because we allow it to happen,.
2366 2366 I welcome the decision on MPLADS. I have been arguing for long that the approximately Rs 7,000 crore given to MPs & MLAs annually for development works should be used as a corpus for state funding of elections.
2367 2367 we can not be selective, we have to be upfront, bold and say minority communalism is as dangerous to India as ( much as ) majority communalism is.
2368 2368 Congress leaders have to reinvent themselves. The party has to reinvent itself if it has to be relevant. Otherwise, we are staring at irrelevance. Our arrogance has to go, even after six years out of power sometimes, some of us behave as if we are still ministers,.
2369 2369 This is a wonderful book. This contains the writings and speeches of one of the most intelligent prime ministers of our country. English language is very important. But Kannada language should also be given equal importance. Similarly Hindi also. This book has important details of Nehru 's life. I appreciate the effort of Prof Purushotam in writing such a wonderful book. This is not a subject which needs to be invented by Congress party. Nehru is the emblem of India. He is not limited to Congress party alone. He is the wealth of the whole country. More research should be done in this regard cutting across political party lines.
2371 2371 The prevailing model, indeed, in plutocratic America is that taxpayers fund the vast majority of research and development ( R & D ) for pharmaceuticals and then the intellectual know-how is turned over, free of charge, to private industry so that it can market these drugs under 20 years of patent protection and then make a fortune at the cost of the American people.
2373 2373 We 've launched more wars than any other country in modern times. We 've launched war after war after war. So I do n't think it 's really our business to change the regime.
2376 2376 If people are panicked because hospitals are overflowing and loved ones are dying, the hit to the economy will be even worse than if we remain in lockdown,.
2377 2377 The general thinking at the moment is V-shaped -- that this is a problem here and now. The Fed eases monetary policy, and we 're back up and running pretty quickly. I suspect that wo n't be the case,.
2380 2380 the safe haven in the world, economically, and it probably is going to be the safest place to be, given this global pandemic.
2383 2383 However, there are Brown students and employees who, due to age or underlying health conditions, may be at significant risk if they contract the virus. We must take steps to protect them, as well as other vulnerable members of the local community who interact with Brown students on a regular basis.
2389 2389 1t. org presents an important example of how stakeholders from all walks of life and all ages can work together to achieve a single, globally significant goal.
2391 2391 Our best and only response to it should be to take concerted action. The COVID Action Platform is at the center of our mission and we draw upon all our members and partners, communities and capabilities to make it a success.
2392 2392 For a protest, opposition unity is important as protest becomes easier. Unity is important. If protest is for a proper reason but if there 's no unity, and we stop protesting, I do n't agree to it. If there 's no unity we still have to move on whatever is necessary to be done,.
2393 2393 The constructive role of friendship applies not only across the national borders, but also within. Divisions between groups and sects not only damage our social lives, but they can also work as barriers to intellectual progress within and across the nations. Friendship is, in fact, central to the development of knowledge,.
2396 2396 But even if unity is not there, then that does n't mean we will stop protesting. As I said, unity makes protest easier but if unity is not there still, we have to move on and do whatever is necessary,.
2397 2397 For many businesses, unfortunately, there 's really nothing customers can do right now, but for those businesses, we 're saying make sure you come back early and often when they 're open again because this really is turning into an economic emergency for small businesses,.
2399 2399 If prolonged and widespread, this would likely affect Japan 's tourism and retail activities through a decline in tourist arrivals, and spending from China and elsewhere,.
2400 2400 In particular, it endorsed initiatives to : Enhance access to our emergency facilities, as now some 85 countries indicate they rely on them for financial support ; build up our capacity to serve our poorest members ; and help countries experiencing foreign exchange shortages, including possibly by short-term liquidity line.
2406 2406 Global growth would be about 0.1 percentage points lower,.
2408 2408 Under any scenario, the global growth in 2020 will drop below last year 's level. How far it will fall, and for how long, is difficult to predict, and would depend on the epidemic, but also on the timeliness and effectiveness of our actions.
2415 2415 We are still at the point of quite a lot of uncertainty. So I would talk about scenarios rather than projections,.
2418 2418 We should not hide away from what is going on. The climate crisis is upon us,.
2423 2423 People keep asking me what are you going to do with the tickets ? I 'll probably take them back and put them in the vault,.
2425 2425 Once this ( coronavirus crisis ) is put to bed we need to get oasis back for a 1 of gig rite for charity c 'm on Noel we can then go back to our amazing solo careers ( sic ).
2428 2428 With Johnson reluctant to pursue any more delays, there is a clear risk of the process resulting in a no-deal Brexit at the end of the year, the threat of which is likely to limit any upside in the pound.
2429 2429 You have certain moments in time when you can hit it ... Timing matters incredibly.
2432 2432 Now it [ new type of coronavirus ] is added to the list of highly infectious diseases. This will allow to deport foreign citizens, if they are found to have such disease, and to announce special restrictive measures, including isolation and quarantine,.
2433 2433 I think it makes it almost doubly smart that Elon is in Beijing and in Shanghai,.
2435 2435 Today, we 're dealing with an economy where monetary policy has very little by way of traction. What we 're working on is to establish very solid conditions for the recovery period so that when the recovery does start, it will have the best momentum that we can give it,.
2439 2439 So, traders are forced to begrudgingly walk back risk for fear of getting steamrolled if another hugely detrimental headline hits.
2443 2443 The key will be the OPEC + communique that is articulated to the market once the meetings conclude, to gauge whether the wording signals a collective harmonious voice amongst the group that plausibly helps to rebalance oil markets, or whether it 's merely complex face-saving maths,.
2448 2448 The economic impact is already visible in the countries most affected by the outbreak. For example, in China, manufacturing and service sector activity declined dramatically in February. While the drop in manufacturing is comparable to the start of the global financial crisis, the decline in services appears larger this time-reflecting the large impact of social distancing,.
2449 2449 tentative signs that growth may be stabilising.
2452 2452 We see India recovering. There is a significant recovery coming in in the next fiscal year. There is a fair amount of monetary stimulus in the system, corporate tax cuts are also there -- these should help with recovery in growth,.
2456 2456 I think there will inevitably be some scarring effect here that will persist for a while but hopefully relatively small,.
2457 2457 Without these certificate of need regulations, we would have more beds and more supply in order to help critically ill patients get over this disease,.
2459 2459 It needs to get to the people, because the people who need it, a large portion of our distribution is seniors, and they 're not supposed to get out, go around and go shopping,.
2461 2461 I just caution that you do n't want to over-react to volatility in the markets if you 're a monetary policymaker,.
2462 2462 should be open-minded to reassess their view of the economy on the basis of all the information provided, including those of participants in the financial markets.
2463 2463 You 're a central bank. You should be representing the public,.
2467 2467 really should n't be worried.
2468 2468 Some games were really good for bonding them, some were really good for them learning about each other, some were good for testing who 's a catfish, some could have been more divisive,.
2469 2469 It was the same system [ from the U.K. show so that ] we knew what things were working, which cast was popping. We were making story decisions as we cut it ; we could change the game or move elements of the game around as the story developed.
2473 2473 NATO currently has around 16,000 troops in Afghanistan and we are ready to adjust that force if the Taliban is able to demonstrate the will and the ability to reduce violence and we see a path to peace,.
2476 2476 The new ideas we are losing today could show up as fewer new products in 2021 and beyond, lowering long-run growth.
2479 2479 I 'm fairly certain he knew how I would feel about it, though. Let me just say that the definition of the toxic male privilege in our industry is people saying, ` Well, he 's always been nice to me' when I 'm raising valid concerns about artists and their rights to own their music. Of course he 's nice to you. If you 're in this room you have something he needs.
2481 2481 But as a large-scale permanent program it would be very difficult to finance.
2483 2483 But there 's just absolutely no way anyone should risk having the symptoms I 've had. Even though I 've not needed hospital, it 's been really unpleasant and scary. People should be following whatever government advice they can to avoid this, and to avoid the possibility of giving someone else symptoms like mine.
2484 2484 CAA is an Act to correct our betrayal of those Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Parsis who on assurance stayed back ( in those countries ). The BJP government kept that promise. How can you find fault with us for keeping a promise which was made by Mahatma Gandhi and several leaders afterwards,.
2485 2485 Air India disinvestment process restarts today. THIS DEAL IS WHOLLY ANTI NATIONAL and I WILL FORCED TO GO TO COURT. WE can not SELL OUR FAMILY SILVER ( sic ).
2486 2486 For a change I am on the side of Rajnikant on the E. V. R. Naicker 1971 rally issue of parading Ram and Sita in a derogatory. This is a fact and Cho had published it in Thuglak. If the cine actor stays firm I will back him in courts if he wants ( sic ),.
2488 2488 This is mostly because there are areas where private sectors can not meet India 's aspirations ... There are certain sectors that can be explored and developed by PSUs only,.
2496 2496 We know that one of the biggest challenges for local businesses is breaking into new or expanding supply chains and that 's why we 're making sure there are opportunities for everyone to be part of North East Link.
2500 2500 But a more significant impact can not be ruled out,.
2505 2505 This is a virus. It 's not a storm or an earthquake or hurricane. We have plenty .... We are at the start of the peak of this outbreak, so we have time,.
2509 2509 We know that by middle school, more boys than girls want to lead and if you ask girls why they do n't want to lead ... they do n't want to be called bossy, and they do n't want to be disliked. We call girls bossy on the playground. We call them too aggressive or other B-words in the workplace. They 're bossy as little girls, and then they 're aggressive, political, shrill, too ambitious as women.
2511 2511 Engaged ! ! ! Tom Bernthal, you are my everything. I could not love you more,.
2520 2520 If Dr. Shelton comes onto the board of governors and just represents a different point of view, there is no harm to it and possibly some good,.
2524 2524 the health of our planet plays a super important role in spreading or containing what we refer to as Zoonotic diseases.
2525 2525 In supporting countries to build circularity into their economies, PACE can play a powerful role in advancing the climate, biodiversity and resource efficiency with both scale and speed.
2529 2529 I always thought that if we got hit it would be a shock to aggregate demand, and that is what I think it is,.
2530 2530 we will deploy a broader set of tools proactively to provide accommodation when shocks are likely to push the policy rate to its lower bound.
2532 2532 I do feel that in a multi-identity, complex country ( like India ), expression of dissent is an essential part of democracy. To my knowledge, everyone recognises this. And if that 's not happening, then we should worry.
2537 2537 I would like to thank Minister Altmaier for his collaborative spirit and commitment to building a secure and sustainable energy future. It is my hope that this report will help Germany as it undertakes this very important energy transition,.
2550 2550 At that point, debt would be higher as a percentage of GDP than at any point since just after World War II and more than double what it has averaged over the past 50 years,.
2553 2553 We would like to recommend ( the resumption of classes ) in areas that are not affected,.
2554 2554 We do n't want to sacrifice or disrupt the children 's classes because the school buildings are their home,.
2555 2555 As I said earlier, it was a bit of an insult to Bicolanos to say that there are 70,000 illiterates walking around in Bicol. I do n't think that 's totally accurate because we 're looking at different levels,.
2557 2557 For 2020 the EBF believes that listed banks should not accrue dividends or undertake share buybacks so as to maintain maximum capital preservation and bank Boards will be deciding on dividend policy and any distribution amounts at year-end,.
2566 2566 It gave me an opportunity to do something which I think all of us need to do more, and which I came to understand and appreciate is absolutely essential to what the Ed School does for so many professionals : and that was to reflect on my own practice as a university president.
2572 2572 When we think about the state of the world, it is very clear that the state of the world is not where we would like it to be,.
2573 2573 Congress has no choice but to pass the House bill, or something like it, and then immediately start work on a * much * bigger bill to push cash at small/medium-sized businesses, the self-employed, and households.
2575 2575 On the face of it, this looks like an inconsequential, uninteresting payroll report. But nothing could be further from the truth ; we ca n't stress enough that three straight months of substantial overshoots against the surveys means that the surveys are wrong ; labour demand remains strong enough to continue pushing down the unemployment rate.
2576 2576 For me country comes first, national security and national interest above issues like jobs, education and health. If country is not safe, what will happen to other issues,.
2579 2579 Our community hospital paired a suite of virtual reality experiences -- which can reduce apprehension and panic during withdrawal -- with a traditional medication-assisted detox program for patients suffering from substance abuse.
2580 2580 The most important thing you can do for the economy is slow the virus or show it has a lower bound,.
2585 2585 You should give people guidance on how to have sex less dangerously.
2586 2586 Because of these Boeing problems and now because of the China virus, it 's really questionable how well future hard or soft data is going to measure the underlying health of the U.S. manufacturing industry,.
2593 2593 If ever there was a time for a CEO and Board to be held accountable, it is now.
2594 2594 could present an excellent synergistic acquisition opportunity.
2595 2595 If you can avoid insolvencies of companies, the banks are safe,.
2598 2598 That 's when I realized filmmaking was such a positive creative outlet that people can use to express important things about their identity, their lives and communities,.
2609 2609 We should also be sober about the limitations of the legislation,.
2614 2614 The economic policy conditions would not be as strict as with classic aid loans,.
2615 2615 we acted decisively but the fiscal policy should be first in combating the crisis,.
2616 2616 If it comes to an epidemic in Germany then ... direct economic effects are to be expected,.
2627 2627 You might have a manufacturing company, manufacturing some good like pasta or rice, and previously they did it with just one shift,.
2632 2632 This inquiry will allow the ACCC to assess whether these advertising and ad tech markets are operating effectively and, importantly, gauge whether they are working well for a range of different stakeholders,.
2633 2633 I think we 'll have a few consumer guarantee issues,.
2634 2634 If they do n't, we 'll start calling them out.
2636 2636 These new laws will enable us to take electricity companies to court if we have evidence that they are engaging in prohibited conduct in breach of these new provisions,.
2640 2640 Our primary goal at UR Medicine is to provide the very best quality of care in an environment that is safe for everyone. To protect our patients, their loved ones, and our caregivers, we must manage their exposure to any illnesses that are easily spread.
2649 2649 buying gift certificates or prepaying for services to the restaurants, bars, and other physical businesses you normally frequent,.
2650 2650 What I 'm watching closely is the government 's response. The risk is that we do too little, not that we do too much. And unfortunately it 's more likely that we do too little. If we want the economy to spring back when the pandemic subsides we need bold fiscal policy efforts now.
2651 2651 I think that it 's actually a very exciting time in sponsorship,.
2652 2652 We have also submitted a proposal to the local authority to trial a rail-seating area within the stadium. Our belief is that the introduction of rail seating would enhance spectator safety in areas of the stadium where, as with other clubs, we have seen examples of persistent standing. We hope to have news on our application soon.
2657 2657 We must build back better, by ensuring that we are climate-conscious in rebuilding and by leveraging the digital economy.
2663 2663 Locally, buyers look for value, features, current decor, large yards, nearby amenities such as trails or parks and anything that makes life more enjoyable for their family and pets,.
2665 2665 We call them her miracles. I raised her to be proud of what she can do and to give back.
2668 2668 New NAFTA adds stronger language to ensure that the obligations of all three countries under multilateral environmental agreements, including the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, can be fully enforced,.
2669 2669 Regulating here is not the preferred option, but it is a fallback option if we do n't see the required change,.
2677 2677 Given what we know at the moment, I think that is true.
2678 2678 The first customer at my register read it and wrote down on the small white board ` It must be hard with everyone wearing masks ! Thank you for your help,'.
2679 2679 Think of the poor countries that already start with a paucity of ventilators and are dealing with the same crisis,.
2680 2680 We have a financial system that is impaired. I have always maintained that we need to clean it up so that it can function as necessary. The problem now is that the RBI ca n't provide credit support to businesses,.
2684 2684 A rate cut of 25 basis points in early 2020 is the likely scenario.
2692 2692 Normally you 'd lose half a million people every month for six months. This time you might lose one million a week for three weeks,.
2693 2693 If things go right it 'll be the most rapid recovery we 've seen,.
2694 2694 My local burrito shop, which used to be a thriving business, could go belly-up any day now,.
2696 2696 If the demographic trends are maintained and ultra-Orthodox participation in the labor market remains as it is today, maintaining tax revenues as a share of GDP will require a 16 % increase in direct taxes in 2018 terms,.
2699 2699 and we thought we could manage it a little better. We 've got a lot of work to do. We 're not winning, and the record is the record, so we just have to keep plugging away.
2705 2705 In addition to residential land sales, HHC has a significant, under-appreciated profit opportunity in the commercial development of its MPCs [ master planned communities ]. As MPCs reach a tipping point of residential density, demand arises for retail, office, multi-family and hospitality development in HHC-owned MPC town centers. Over time, the stable and recurring real estate cash flows ( net operating income or NOI ) from these properties will represent a growing percentage of HHC 's value.
2709 2709 With this study, we thought we could establish insider trading. This turned out not to be the case, and hence the content on insider trading was removed in subsequent versions. The version online has since been updated.
2720 2720 Immigrants do n't need to worry about the way this thing may affect their chances of becoming a legal permanent resident, as unemployment benefits are exempted from the public charge rule,.
2730 2730 Even if it stopped today,.
2735 2735 Relative to where things were three or four years ago, things have cooled off a little.
2738 2738 You have to ask yourself why people keep having kids if it does n't make you happy. The evidence appears to be that they are expensive and parents struggle with their finances.
2740 2740 If copyright issues continue to annoy foreign companies,.
2742 2742 That 's why the platforms should come together and develop shared, clear, consistent, enforceable rules to protect voters from becoming easy marks for disinformation campaigns.
2743 2743 We have been placed in a challenging operational situation where the airline can not continue with its global operations as a result of these restrictions on anyone who has visited China. If we continue operations, the significant numbers of crew who would have travelled to China, would be limited to operate on certain flights, reducing our operational effectiveness. We will immediately resume our operations to China once the governmental restrictions are lifted.
2745 2745 I think that the Magnitsky Act is just in its infancy.
2751 2751 If you do n't have something, you press a button.
2752 2752 Some argue that SDRs may drive IMF conditionality out of business,.
2753 2753 The impact could be far-reaching if the crisis prolongs,.
2756 2756 Official estimates place annual average GDP growth between 2011-12 and 2016-17 at about 7 per cent. We estimate that actual growth may have been about 4.5 per cent with a 95 per cent confidence interval of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent,.
2757 2757 Rate cuts will not prevent the spread of the virus or offset the immediate economic costs of containment measures.
2761 2761 I think it did get there if you look at the screens, but it would have to have been a pretty quick party,.
2767 2767 But do n't simultaneously pretend that that 's a route toward affordability. Affordability is created by mass-produced cheap housing or mass-produced cheap commercial space. And you might not like it aesthetically, but that is the affordable route.
2769 2769 I still feel that this is still critical to the safety of our community and that there is no reason why we would not take action,.
2772 2772 These small and medium-sized firms are often crucial links in the supply chain. If these links are broken, it will be much more difficult to recover from a recession,.
2775 2775 You ca n't use BARRA or some other risk system and expect this scenario to come out of it. No one thought in our lifetime we would see this,.
2779 2779 can expect similarly tough scrutiny.
2780 2780 Considering the difficulty of identifying the truly needy and the problems inherent in trying to do so, sending every American a $ 1,000 check asap would be a good start,.
2781 2781 From my standpoint, the debt and deficits today are less worrisome than they were three or four years ago,.
2783 2783 Our focus is on their health and safety and doing what we can to combat the spread of the virus. Some things are bigger than the game of hockey.
2786 2786 Stock market drops like this are very scary and make a lot of consumers, whether they own a lot of stock or not, rather cautious,.
2787 2787 Coming out of the pandemic, middle-class voters may be more aware of scary scenarios that we may never have experienced,.
2790 2790 Students are allowed to wear masks inside classrooms if they are unwell or as a precautionary measure.
2794 2794 We ca n't think of just surviving the storm. We must also be able to operate later,.
2797 2797 I think that on this day of hope we should also display some confidence.
2800 2800 This study helps us understand where laws facilitate or hinder women 's economic participation. It has incentivised countries to undertake reforms that can eliminate gender imbalances,.
2801 2801 At the end of the day, if we have to lay off all our early educators if the rates are n't paid, we 're looking at a tough system to rebuild,.
2803 2803 I see the situation as a slow-moving systemic financial crisis. It is so slow-moving that you almost can watch it coming,.
2804 2804 I want to stress that these measures are not to induce anxiety or fear ; rather, they are to help us cope with the current situation regarding the Coronavirus,.
2807 2807 It is this discrepancy that may help explain why the cross-currency basis swaps look so distorted now.
2808 2808 The UK and EU have not begun the formal negotiation process of trade talks, but both sides appear to be doing their best to antagonise the other,.
2809 2809 Weaker activity in Q4 19 saw the central bank soften its neutral stance. Still, it does not seem particularly close to cutting rates. Investors seem to favor a cut near mid-year at Governor Poloz 's last meeting,.
2811 2811 It ´ s been a good 10 years and his three years probably better than expected,.
2814 2814 We met and drew up the dimensions [ of the intubation shield arch ] and played with it and thought about how we would do it. Two hours later, I believe, he had a prototype,.
2816 2816 I think we have to fight at every inch that we have to prevent the preemption.
2818 2818 Our goal should be to build the broadest possible grassroots struggle to win a strong Amazon Tax, without limiting ourselves to what is acceptable to the political establishment,.
2828 2828 Inflationary concerns should further support gold prices as the currency of last resort,.
2830 2830 Some people thought he will be a better Finance Minister,.
2833 2833 ... If we increase crop yield per year, our production will increase and we will be able to export more. The solution does n't lie in loan waiver ... we have to educate our farmers in modern ways of farming.
2837 2837 If it rebounds it can probably make up for the loss in February. If it stays low those numbers are going to compound and the situation for the global value chain is going to deteriorate even further.
2841 2841 It appears that the main reason for this slowdown was the non-banking financial institutions experiencing turbulence,.
2853 2853 We see impact on travel and on tourism. This in the short-term is likely to bring some slow down. In the long-term, we do n't know. We have to assess how quickly action is being taken to contain the spread of Coronavirus and how effective this action is,.
2855 2855 Its global impact would be amplified through more substantial supply chain disruptions and a more persistent drop in investor confidence, especially if the epidemic spreads beyond China.
2860 2860 So to support the recovering growth, it 's important for policymakers to do no harm. Monetary policy should remain accommodative and countries that have fiscal space should use it to improve social and human capital and climate friendly infrastructure,.
2862 2862 The housing shortage is about densification. People go crazy over the issue, but it means less traffic. It 's better for the environment. If we build more housing downtown, we do n't need to build houses on hillsides.
2866 2866 More intense and innovative use of web technologies can help public administrations modernise their structures and functions to improve overall performance ... [ such as ] fostering greater transparency, accountability and engagement between the government and its citizens.
2867 2867 If I am particularly proud of something during the last 50 years, it is of having created many years ago the community of young leaders,.
2870 2870 So I think you will see those different modes and that evolution throughout the series of we 're in this graphic novel/superhero world, and then we 're back in the past and it becomes much more sobering and somber and horrific, but in a way that, to me, is not as gratuitous and more suggestive. And that pushes against the poppiness of the 70s.
2871 2871 How do I do so without borrowing from a real person 's specific life or experience ?.
2873 2873 It was the moment consecrated in time and memory that I sought to make good on doing my parthowever big or however smallto ensure the promise of ` Never Again.'.
2874 2874 It is the thing I go to sleep thinking about and the thing I wake up working to honor.
2876 2876 Under the internet 's self-regulatory model, you might expect industry codes of conduct to which platforms would be held accountable with some kind of oversight or monitoring -- but that seems to have fallen apart and it 's every platform for itself and no accountability.
2881 2881 The air supply to a modern airliner is very different from a movie theater or an office building,.
2883 2883 I am delighted that the work of arguably the single-most influential British artist of all time will now appear on another two billion works of art - the new £ 20 notes that people can start using today.
2885 2885 Pension fund investments held by millions could be rendered worthless by climate change crisis, warns Mark Carney.
2887 2887 Once climate change becomes a clear and present danger to financial stability, it could already be too late to stabilize the atmosphere at two degrees,.
2888 2888 could become the greatest commercial opportunity of our time.
2892 2892 If you look at the average political science department among strong universities in the country, it 's unusual to see a large [ group ] of people who play both roles -- practice and theory,.
2894 2894 By 2050, one in four global consumers will be African. But Africa currently attracts less than 4 % of global foreign direct investment. Strong actions from countries to improve rule of law and take on vested interests could create the right incentives to spur investment by strengthening financial systems, building confidence in financial markets, and enabling more productive private-sector activity.
2897 2897 I can not emphasise enough how urgent it is for authorities to lean forward in funding outbreak-related health spending and the need to match demand with supply of the necessary protective and treatment health products,.
2899 2899 It 's God 's day to rest, so it may as well be mine too !.
2902 2902 I do n't think it 's a long way away,.
2903 2903 But you ca n't stop them coming -- that would be absolutely wrong,.
2904 2904 The Home Office appears to be a complete mess. I 've never seen anything like it before. I worry at the chaotic and destructive way the whole Government is operating ... all the reports of Dominic Cummings throwing his weight around. None of this is the sign of a confident, purposeful government. It looks more like insecure and chaotic lashing out.
2906 2906 I think we 're going to get close to the apex. This week may be the apex.
2910 2910 And on net, the proposals he put forward today are probably a wash at best. You have the benefit of some of the tax proposals washed out by the negative of the travel ban with Europe.
2911 2911 We 're trying to watch consumer spending. I think that 's where it 's going to show up first,.
2912 2912 We 'll likely see much slower growth and recession risks will rise,.
2914 2914 would not advocate going back to a prior historical standard.
2917 2917 Rival nations are working very diligently to have an alternative to the dollar. I think it is very important that we get ahead of the curve to ensure that the dollar continues to offer the best currency in the world.
2921 2921 I think of people like Will Smith, who has a young family and just returned from serving his country,.
2922 2922 In any kind of a crisis, public health or not,.
2925 2925 In the past four or five years it 's made a significant difference, particularly when we had the collapse in oil prices back in late 2014, early 2015, and we drove interest rates back down to 0.5 per cent,.
2926 2926 You know, if President Trump were re-elected, I do n't think he would suddenly change the tools of how he operates, so I think we would be in for continued uncertainty,.
2927 2927 I 'm not dismissing the virus, it matters a great deal to markets. But let 's face it : we were in a situation where a correction would n't have surprised any of us for any reason,.
2930 2930 plenty of uncertainty remains around the implications of the US-China agreement for Canadian exports and around whether any more of the new tariffs can be rolled back.
2932 2932 It is gon na happen, believe you me -- it 's gon na happen very fucking soon because he 's greedy and he loves money and he knows that it 's got to happen soon or it wo n't happen.
2936 2936 Are you at home or at the pub ?.
2938 2938 It 's gon na happen very fucking soon because [ Noel 's ] greedy and he loves money and he knows that it 's got to happen soon or it wo n't happen.
2940 2940 Whether it lasts three weeks or three months is the critical variable. Some sectors like healthcare will boom but the vast majority of the economy will be affected. So it could be a much more significant sharp recession after which, assuming the virus is conquered, there could be a very sharp recovery. The timing of this is so uncertain that predictions are almost pointless.
2948 2948 Together with Europe and Canada we represent 50 % of the world 's military might and 50 % of the world economy. Together we are strong,.
2949 2949 We need to go heavy in and train. Build everything from the ministry of defense, institutions, command and control, to train forces. NATO can do that. We already do it, but we can scale up,.
2951 2951 to help ensure [ the Islamic State extremist group, or IS ] can not return.
2952 2952 We 've never before entered a bear market because of a viral outbreak. But if you believe we have n't hit the trough and we are in fact headed for bear territory, it 's useful to look to the history of bear markets to get a sense of their duration and intensity,.
2958 2958 The size of food and agriculture in Africa will rise to $ 1 trillion by 2030. The population of Africa, now at 1.2 billion, will double to 2.5 billion by 2050. They all must eat. And only through food and agribusiness can this be achieved,.
2959 2959 But during these times, everyone needs a safe income, without any discrimination between insured and uninsured. Regarding this, the unemployment insurance fund should be set in motion,.
2960 2960 Due to the fact that the Sochi agreement could not be fully implemented, Turkey should re-evaluate the current situation in Idlib with Russia. If need be, the Sochi agreement needs to be amended in line with the new realities in the field. A new cease-fire line should also be considered,.
2961 2961 Everyone who has a conscience should ask themselves this question : For what have you spent the 34-billion-dollar earthquake tax that you collected from this nation ?.
2962 2962 GDP will almost certainly shrink this quarter as well, so Italy will technically be in a recession [ often defined as two consecutive quarters of declining GDP ]. It will probably shrink for the whole year,.
2964 2964 A job and wages guarantee means people can keep their jobs and small business owners can stay in business.
2967 2967 Our estimate is that by the end of June, 20 million people will have lost their jobs -- and I am wondering if even that is optimistic,.
2968 2968 They 're more likely to be living paycheck to paycheck than anyone else, and so if their income falls, they 're more likely to actually have to cut back on necessities like rent and food. So that just makes the recession deeper and longer by pulling even more economic activity out.
2970 2970 persistent shifts in financial market conditions can be informative,.
2972 2972 The data shows that women disproportionately seek jobs -- including full-time jobs -- that are more likely to mesh with family responsibilities, which, for the most part, are still greater for women than for men,.
2974 2974 we have very significant issues, and the one that worries me most is weak productivity growth ... We 've had four or five years now where productivity growth has been very weak ... in my own view it 's linked to very low levels of investment relative to gross domestic product.
2975 2975 Investment expectations are at risk of potentially weakening should the COVID19 impact extend for longer,.
2976 2976 If you took your loan out a while ago, it is worth shopping around and checking in with your lender to see if it can now give you a bigger discount,.
2984 2984 I think there will be opportunities to use the money as creatively as businesses like, for things like more CCTV, extra lighting, street entertainment. Having that extra pot of money could be really important for Armley.
2987 2987 There are things we can do to open up the economy, significantly perhaps, but I do n't see the economy returning to a more normal state until there 's much greater confidence ... that opening up the economy wo n't restart the crisis,.
2990 2990 Low inflation can be dangerous,.
2992 2992 25 per cent of our exports to India is related to palm oil industry, so that will adversely affect our industry. There was no prior indication, so it was like a shock. We do hope that Indian government will reconsider its decision. We are discussing this through our diplomatic channel, if necessary we can also go through political channel,.
2993 2993 If we want to control the health care burden on the U.S. economy, then we have to control hospital prices,.
2994 2994 provide a bit of comfort to the bank that they 're not going to lose everything if they take a few risks with some of their home borrowers and some of their corporate borrowers, and show a bit of compassion.
2995 2995 recent unrest in Libya has seen the country 's National Oil Corporation declaring force majeure, production of about 700kb/d could be held up,.
2996 2996 Within 10 years, these low-carbon fuels would need to account for around 15per cent of overall investment in fuel supply if the world is to get on course to tackle climate change,.
2998 2998 This welcome halt in emissions growth is grounds for optimism that we can tackle the climate challenge this decade,.
3002 3002 As of today, around 15 % of global energy-related greenhouse gas emissions come from the process of getting oil and gas out of the ground and to consumers. A large part of these emissions can be brought down relatively quickly and easily,.
3007 3007 Anant Kumar Hegde is perhaps reflecting the views of his masters. If he is not, his comments should invite the strictest possible action from his party.
3009 3009 He argued India 's case with passion and eloquence. At a time when the Western powers were ruling the roost, he had the temerity and courage to take them on on his terms. But after 1957 or so, his tongue and his manner, barring occasional flashes of constructive engagement, created a negative global image for Nehru and India. For years thereafter, the ghost of Krishna Menon lingered over both the substance and style of Indian democracy-needlessly argumentative and combative. And that ghost still lingers,.
3010 3010 Let us see. Do n't want to comment on judicial matters but if the situation does not turn in our favour, we will continue to sit here.
3011 3011 Fine, I understand the emotion and sentiments. Initially ( protest ) in four days, five days ... but after a while, I think it served the BJP 's interest to keep Shaheen Bagh going, it served the communal Muslim interests to keep Shaheen Bagh going.
3012 3012 But our projections also suggest that over the long-term, changes in fiscal policy must be made to address the budget situation.
3013 3013 But the question is whether there are spillovers to demand, and the extent of those. They may be able to address some of the spillovers.
3017 3017 And then as students held up their signs, I said, and also, as you can see, passionate. And I said, passion is good.
3020 3020 Congratulations to Regional Director May Eclar and the regional office for launching Sulong EduKalidad and this great exhibit and sharing your secrets and recipe when it comes to reading approaches,.
3021 3021 I think this is going to be larger than the Great Recession. I hope it does n't last as long, but the magnitude of the shock is bigger.
3025 3025 in a few years we might be facing serious shortages of gas.
3027 3027 This is not to say that there will not be pain points for individual consumers who were previously having problems, such as some FTTN and fixed wireless customers. And some will need assistance in remotely accessing their work systems or coming to grips with new applications,.
3032 3032 All the truculence is very unhelpful with respect to the areas of cooperation that could be there,.
3034 3034 I do n't think pushing 10-year rates down from 100 basis points to 50 basis points or 20 basis points has [ a ] significant incremental effect.
3036 3036 If it is a return to restriction, starting from a much less favorable point and much more disease spread, then the cumulative economic loss will be greatly magnified. The costs we have already borne will have been totally in vain.
3037 3037 But certainly, unemployment could go quite a lot higher.
3057 3057 People should have gold and this may be a good time to increase holdings in gold -- in fact I 'm thinking that myself.
3059 3059 This should get much more attention from policymakers. Allowed to persist this can leave scars on India 's economy and polity for long years,.
3062 3062 It is more than five times as large as any tax increase enacted since. And even if it falls short of the campaign 's projections, it would be the largest peacetime tax increase in American history.
3063 3063 The BOJ wo n't hesitate to take additional easing steps if risks become very large and increase the chance that the momentum toward achieving its 2 % price target will be lost,.
3066 3066 Morrison keeps saying it can be added to. Maybe he 's already intending to top it up.
3073 3073 It will allow Indian companies to tap a new pool of investors, other than Indian investors or foreign portfolio investors, many of whom may not have come to India,.
3078 3078 If it goes into summer, all bets are off. You 're looking at a supply chain disruption unlike any we 've ever seen,.
3079 3079 I think that the odds of a global recession are close to 100 % right now.
3082 3082 Postponing COP26 is the right thing to do-public health and safety must come first now,.
3084 3084 They 're going to be furious and they 're never going to watch the show again. I do n't blame them for a second. I think that 's great.
3086 3086 We are not on any preset course. We will continue to monitor external developments and how they may affect our outlook for growth and inflation.
3087 3087 As we have a diversified economy ... one sector may be more affected than another. But then again, because of the diversified nature of our economy, other factors will be able to cushion the impact of the coronavirus ( Covid-19 ) on selected sectors of the economy,.

3089 3089 Banks should immediately cease all equity buy backs and dividends, and should be ready to suspend bonuses to a thick layer of senior and other highly remunerated staff in order to maximize their capacity to lend. If the health crisis lasts into next year, credit supply and the economy will be held back by distributions allowed during the current year,.
3091 3091 Possibly it is not very good to sing praises to one 's bosses, but I think I should say a couple of words about First Deputy Prime Minister Anton Siluanov. He does a very important job. His readiness to use modern technologies to address crucial issues makes the performance of the ` collective Ministry of Finance' very effective,.
3094 3094 In addition, [ it is necessary ] to spend, perhaps, the money of the National Wealth Fund on investments in infrastructure projects, which are to pay back. This is so far what I consider the most important today,.
3097 3097 They are not going to investigate anything, you could have the worst ship catastrophe, no one from the Bahamas or Panama is going to come do anything,.
3100 3100 Any progress in this would require good cooperation with the international financial institutions, the World Bank, [ the ] IMF. There 's no way we could reach any understanding on this under the shadow of the SST,.
3106 3106 For example, a recent erroneous online message circulating in several languages around the world and purporting to be a UNICEF communication appears to indicate, among other things, that avoiding ice cream and other cold foods can help prevent the onset of the disease. This is, of course, wholly untrue,.
3107 3107 Misinformation during times of a health crisis can spread paranoia, fear and stigmatization,.

3117 3117 I learned in 1987 during the crash that the best thing to do is to just stay the course, and that over time, the stock market does reasonably well. I think the mom and pops out there who are down should be adding to positions,.

3138 3138 The number of reported confirmed US cases rose by only 8.4 % yesterday, well below the prior trend, about 13 %, but we are very suspicious of Sunday data. Reported case growth was well below trend last Sunday too. A rebound in reported cases today seems a good bet,.
3139 3139 A 30 % leap in multi-family starts, to a 33-year high, propelled the headline starts number, but single-family starts were strong too, up 11 %. The much warmer-than-usual December weather likely boosted activity, but these are nonetheless very startling numbers, which will lift forecasts for Q4 residential investment,.
3140 3140 It wo n't prevent the economy slowing if the Covid-19 virus takes hold in the U.S., but it will ease the cost of working capital for businesses if demand falters or supply chains lengthen, and it signals to markets that the Fed has their backs.

3188 3188 As has previously been stated, there will not be a sharp transition between containment and delay phases. Many of the actions taken during containment will still continue in any delay phase. Responses may vary between different regions, depending on the circumstances.
3196 3196 If giving people access to $ 10,000 is a good idea, then just give them $ 10,000. Do n't make them rob their own super accounts. In fact, maybe they should be putting $ 10,000 in people 's super accounts, rather than taking it out, so super funds can be buying shares, not selling them at a discount.
3200 3200 We should prepare, not panic, look at facts, not fear. And some people are at fear, other people are saying ` it 's a hoax.' When people are dying, it 's not a hoax.

3213 3213 Nationalist sentiments may make a counter-claim of some kind of a secluded flourishing of science and mathematics only in their country, detached from the rest of the world and unrelated to what we can learn from others, but that is not how science and mathematics and culture ultimately proceed,.
3222 3222 I think we 're beginning to see an inflection away from those places.
3227 3227 You do n't know if anyone is really paying attention. In one conference call I was on, I thought the background noise I was hearing was actually a vacuum cleaner. When I asked ` is somebody vacuuming,' the sound mysteriously stopped.

3314 3314 the financial sector will have to grapple with preventing the traditional type of crisis, and handle newer ones, including climate-related shocks.

3380 3380 This outlet, while not relieving the entire pressure, does show, first, to the world that we can actually get a pipeline to the coast. And secondly, it allows us to be exposed to the higher prices in the world market than what we 're seeing out of the North American market.

3782 3782 Currently people in financial hardship wanting to withdraw Kiwisaver may go to a local budget service to talk through options or get help completing the paperwork. The evidence is that many people do have other options. That can create a win-win-win situation -- their retirement savings are n't reduced, the Kiwisaver scheme remains strong and they are on a pathway to financial capability. We look forward to discussing with Government and Kiwisaver companies how to progress these excellent proposals.

3804 3804 We would like to thank the Metropolitan Police and Trading Standards for their assistance with this matter.
3807 3807 It 's absolutely clear in the data, whether both the survey data and the hard data, that it 's had an impact, a notable impact, on investment and of course that flows through to productivity.
3808 3808 overall UK activity likely stagnated in the final quarter of 2019.
3809 3809 If that does not happen, then we may need to lower interest rates to support UK growth and ensure that we return inflation to our 2 percent target sustainably.
3813 3813 I think in the US, we 're going to have a very terrible second quarter.
3816 3816 Case growth continues to slow in continental western Europe, though we 're ignoring the Sunday data on grounds of unreliability. The key point for major European countries is that daily deaths are likely to be falling outright by the end of this week, following the pattern in Italy and Spain,.
3819 3819 Total layoffs between the March and April payroll surveys look destined to reach perhaps 16 to 20 million, consistent with the unemployment rate leaping to 13 to 16 percent. In one month.
3828 3828 It 's hard enough to stay healthy for 16 games, and so I can see that side of the argument. I was trying to take in both sides as much as I could, and tried to weigh the pros and cons. At the end of the day, for the majority of the league, what we were getting in return for that 17th game, I felt more than made up for it.
3832 3832 The IMF 's revamped Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust can now provide rapid debt service relief on IMF debt obligations to more of our poorest and most vulnerable members. This will help them to channel more of their scarce financial resources to their vital emergency medical and other relief efforts,.
3833 3833 the virus will likely cut off 0.1 % from global growth, and drag down growth for China 's economy to 5.6 %, which is 0.4 % lower from its January outlook.
3836 3836 Last year, we ended up with 2.9 % growth. It would have been less than 2.5 % which, by the judgment of the IMF, means recession, so we have avoided that,.
3839 3839 ought to begin to build standards for disclosure of climate risks.
3842 3842 We think it is now the time to put in place precautionary measures should the outbreak become more severe,.
3844 3844 The CCRT can currently provide about US $ 500 million in grant-based debt service relief, including the recent US $ 185 million pledge by the U.K. and US $ 100 million provided by Japan as immediately available resources. Others, including China and the Netherlands, are also stepping forward with important contributions. I urge other donors to help us replenish the Trust 's resources and boost further our ability to provide additional debt service relief for a full two years to our poorest member countries,.
3845 3845 In terms of scenarios, the more most likely scenario we now view is a V-shaped impact. In other words, sharp decline in economic activities in China, followed by a rapid recovery and a total impact on China relatively contained. Therefore, impact on the world economy also contained.
3846 3846 The size matters. What matters perhaps even more is well-targeted measures,.
3848 3848 For now, 3.3 per cent is our forecast [ for global economic growth ]. There may be a cut of 0.1 to 0.2 per cent. But again, I wish I had the ability to look into a crystal ball. This is a particular case where I advise everybody not to jump to premature conclusions. There is still a great deal of uncertainly. We operate with scenarios [ of the virus 's impact ] not yet within projections.
3855 3855 There really is n't much we can do in terms of fiscal policy,.
3859 3859 The government must go for an expansionary budget,.
3865 3865 One could imagine a world in the next few months where everyone is tested and all but the immune compromised go back to a socially distanced but more normal life.
3866 3866 The crisis has also made manifestly clear the need to recapitalize Fannie and Freddie so that the private sector becomes the first loss capital in the housing finance system, which should provide even greater urgency for a recapitalization and privatization of the two companies.
3867 3867 Without this capital, HHC would have had to mothball many of its projects.
3869 3869 Even fast-growing markets could be hurt and unable to further expand because of weakening affordability conditions. We must improve affordability by building more homes in line with local job market growth,.
3878 3878 This cash-burning Musk vanity project is worth vastly less than its over $ 130 billion enterprise value and -- thanks to nearly $ 30 billion in debt, purchase and lease obligations -- may eventually be worth zero,.
3879 3879 I think the most important thing will be the dispersion of views,.
3881 3881 It tells you about the risks if this goes on for several weeks or several months,.
3882 3882 It appears that the very people who were supposed to benefit from the Hammurabi wage and price restrictions were driven out of the market by those and other statutes.
3885 3885 The irony of it is, it 's just going to be the two of us sitting at the table. We ca n't have our kids and we ca n't have anybody here. But virtually, we could literally have up to thousands of people,.
3886 3886 There 's no business if we are all dead,.
3892 3892 Now we believe that this recommendation should be considered by everyone,.
3893 3893 had to do everything it could to protect its people.
3897 3897 The government has to do a huge amount of work and significantly strengthen all its fields, and we have everything we need for that : approved plans, resources, targets. And work on national projects must also be intensified,.
3899 3899 There has never been a greater need for constructive international engagement on the continent. Besides, the global economy could reap significant rewards from positive engagement,.
3904 3904 young people have a right to be angry. They should have seats at every table.

3921 3921 We stand ready to help until every woman can move through her life without facing legal barriers to her success,.
3924 3924 When things go from bad to very very bad like they did last week, investors take leverage down as fast as they can. They book profits to make up for other losses. Ouch,.
3927 3927 If this becomes a world issue, with ripples through many countries and many economies, then that 's different type of event than as I understand it to be today,.
3930 3930 I can really empathize with you -- I can see how important this problem is in your life today.
3933 3933 It is not a viable solution to keep everyone in quarantine for several months, no matter if they belong to a high-risk group, are healthy or already immune.
3936 3936 If the shock leads to a global recession, then you have a financial crisis, because debt levels have gone up and the U.S. housing market is experiencing a bubble just like in 2007. It has n't been a time bomb so far because we have been experiencing growth. That is over now.
3942 3942 And for that, we would have to have paid family and medical leave. And we know how rare that is -- only about 20 % of all workers have it.
3943 3943 At least for the US, the immigrants that we have right now it pretty much looks like a net benefit to US tax payers ... when the government spends money on redistribution, it 's normally for the elderly, not the poor ... and immigrants tend to be young so that means they are a good deal when you let them in and they pay taxes for many decades before they can collect old-age benefits.
3947 3947 But the alternative -- a permanent destruction of productive capacity and therefore of the fiscal base -- would be much more damaging to the economy and eventually to government credit.
3952 3952 It 's within that framework and the analysis that we do and the information that we gather from our contacts, consumer side, labor side, business side, and we make the best policy decisions we can.
3956 3956 We appreciate that regulator and agencies have an obligation to investigate ; if any information is sought from us, as a responsible corporate citizen, we will of course provide the same.
3957 3957 Three countries that will still survive or are in the positive zone are Indonesia, China and India,.
3958 3958 2.5 % or even zero.
3962 3962 We will take it meeting-by-meeting. If this were to resolve in a one-or-two quarter slowdown in growth, that is probably not something that changes the big picture,.
3963 3963 To the extent that [ uncertainty ] was holding back investment, that should be a positive this year.
3968 3968 I certainly had none of this information when working on the budget committees or in discussions,.
3969 3969 Instead of just lecturing, they give you lots of projects, like writing a five-page book in Spanish. It 's neat because it 's a common language and you could go to Mexico, Spain, Venezuela, etc., and talk to the people. I 'd recommend this school to others because there 's lots of hands-on learning, you learn Spanish and you get to be creative, at the same time.
3975 3975 would n't happen unless the ( Republicans ) captured the House and held onto the Senate, which at this point seems unlikely,.
3976 3976 The Federal Reserve does not have a lot of room to maneuver ... I do n't think policy is up to the task to really juice up this economy to get it going again quickly.
3977 3977 This is not going to be business as usual, and the marketing industry is certainly going to see a real impact. I do n't think anyone knows how big. So we 're going to watch and look,.
3981 3981 This is not going to business as usual, and the marketing industry is certainly going to see a real impact. I do n't think anyone knows how big,.
3986 3986 it is quite likely that we are going to be in this world of low interest rates for years, if not decades, because it is driven by structural factors.
3995 3995 However, beyond the direct impact on activity, the Italian measures ... Are likely to weigh significantly further on confidence near-term.
3999 3999 Given the size of the Indian economy in the global GDP right now, if you have a significant downward revision for India, then it does have an impact on global growth so we revised global growth down for 2019 by 0.1 % and the vast majority of that comes from the downgrade for India,.
4002 4002 We have a $ 1 trillion capacity. We are still in a position to meet demands ... IMF can not lend to countries where debt is unsustainable. It is just how the rules of the game are here,.
4004 4004 We 're starting to see if it 's going to have a freezing effect on economic growth and there 's going to be a drop, probably a pretty deep recession.
4009 4009 Regulation may or may not be the answer, but at the moment it seems there 's a big question about who 's making the rules.
4012 4012 We need to know more about what I am protesting about. The head must also join with the heart in protest,.
4014 4014 no famine has ever taken place in the history of the world in a functioning democracy -- be it economically rich ... or relatively poor ... Famines have tended to occur in colonial territories governed by rulers from elsewhere ... or in one-party states ... or in military dictatorships ....
4017 4017 a realistic and forward-looking definition of our goal allows monetary policy to wait if there are good reasons, in order not to react hectically to every change in incoming data. It allows the incorporation of the longer-term risks to price stability.
4029 4029 in the same way and there might be a progression.
4030 4030 And we should all seek to create an environment in which people can challenge and report these behaviours without hesitation or fear of retribution.
4034 4034 There is nothing in your projections that would lead you to believe that investing 99 % of your capital in continued oil and gas production is the sensible way forward. You need a new vision for yourselves that means you can survive in a net zero world,.
4035 4035 Not having diagnosed the illness of the patient, the doctor is helpless. The least the doctor can do is to say ... I am sorry. We made a mistake, will Dr Manmohan Singh come and advise us,.
4036 4036 I would say the patient has been kept out of ICU and incompetent doctors are looking at the patient,.
4037 4037 One of the reasons is that a lot of people struggle with debt for years before they seek financial help. That 's partly because many households bury their heads in the sand about the scale of their debts until something tips them over the edge -- like a mortgage renewal or an unexpected expense.
4039 4039 This application is also on a flood plain, what are the safety devices or do we face a Japanese-style Fukushima disaster ?.
4041 4041 We would like to have this reopened as fast as we can after the crisis.
4046 4046 It would only be a fee-for-service, traditional Medicare model, and that certainly could lead to some controversy.
4049 4049 Huawei is in the same category as Chinese companies implementing projects because the agreement is very clear that companies doing projects must be exempted from taxes. Huawei is rolling out base stations with NetOne,.
4050 4050 History says when these things pass people will go to restaurants, cinemas, theatre, watch sport. Six months after 9/11, an event where it was unsure if people would fly again, passenger travel was back to where it was before the event.
4051 4051 If Muslims become more than 30 %, that country is in danger,.
4053 4053 During Jawaharlal Nehru 's time, our GDP was down to 3.5 per cent. Later when Chandrashekar government was formed, I was in the ministry and we made economic reforms. During P. V. Narasimha Rao 's time, we worked on the economic reforms as a result of which the GDP reached 8 per cent. If our PM works on my suggestions, then our GDP will reach 10 per cent,.
4056 4056 So I think the public can take confidence and, as I mentioned earlier, because these viruses do n't recognise borders or boundaries, we are working in a collective way to ensure an appropriate and proportionate response.
4058 4058 Many of the actions taken during containment will still continue in any delay phase. Responses may vary between different regions, depending on the circumstances.
4060 4060 We never thought about it because we do n't have anything in Michigan.
4061 4061 What 's the cost of doing too much and what 's the cost of doing too little ? I think it 's incredibly asymmetric,.
4062 4062 Right now time is of the essence. I would much rather get people money sooner. Maybe they save it. Maybe they have flexibility to miss some work. Maybe they spend it.
4070 4070 The myriad of titles of chairman, vice-chairman, president, CEO, COO could have been divided up in a way where you still do n't have to have the role ambiguity of the same title,.
4071 4071 The question of the grey list is more complicated. Washington is still looking for wholesale and irreversible steps, and the revelation that Masood Azhar is ` missing' wo n't go down well. This suggests that unless things change in the coming weeks, Pakistan may have trouble convincing FATF to be removed from the grey list.
4073 4073 I hope the whole world can basically do that quickly. This is the key question : how quickly can we do this ?.
4075 4075 If Judge Sullivan were to allow him to do it -- and I do n't think he will -- and he loses [ at trial ], he 's toast,.
4078 4078 That is because high debt levels can make us vulnerable to negative events,.
4079 4079 When financial tensions ease as pandemic runs its course, these extra liquidity demands will dissipate, and the bank 's balance sheet expansion can reverse over time.
4080 4080 In this time of uncertainty it is important we remain focussed on supporting students with opportunities that will benefit their future careers and confidence within their studies. This would not be possible without the willingness of the students and Andrew from Sight Concern.
4087 4087 It continues to give special treatment to fossil fuel interests. It fails to ratify the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which could bring the global community together to reduce the use of HFCs and avoid up to a half degree Celsius in global warming by the end of the century. And like so many of the Trump administration 's proposals, the new NAFTA fails to even mention the words ` climate change.
4093 4093 There will be spot shortages here and there, and there will be some scrambling, but it 's nothing I think consumers need to be concerned about.
4096 4096 Labour is in the concurrent list and depending on how you count, there were around 54 different union statutes on labour. These have now been codified into four. I am not suggesting that four is ideal and we can streamline it further,.
4097 4097 Understanding at the more macro level why some things are happening [ to policy ] now in Western Europe and the US might be easier if we understand the micro level,.
4098 4098 It is also how fast the construction or infrastructure projects outlined in Budget 2020 are rolled out, given that there is a lag effect. The faster these projects get started, it will in turn benefit all the backward and forward linkage business activities,.
4099 4099 Our focus needs to be at this point on testing and getting the pandemic under enough control so we can begin to restore business activity,.
4100 4100 If firms are really damaged and cut back their investment spending on R & D dramatically, or workers become deskilled or lose productive connections to firms, those things can have long-lasting effects,.
4102 4102 the schools, in consultation with the [ Parent-Teacher Association ] leadership, may choose to reschedule or forego the holding of graduation and moving up rites.
4105 4105 It 's been observed that, in the early 20s, investors can plan their finances better with the right knowledge and financial skills as they do n't have a spouse or a child to look after. They should invest at least 50-60 per cent of their monthly income after starting on a job.
4106 4106 A decision on when and whether in-person instruction will resume will be shared in early April. Students will receive additional information about this transition in the next few days.
4108 4108 By becoming a 4 Star Partner, Syrex is able to work even more closely with Check Point to gain an enhanced understanding of its product offerings and how it can be applied to the unique requirements of South African companies,.
4109 4109 The Americans have shown what needs to be done, sending cheques to everyone. We should do the same. A £ 1,000 cheque to every adult, each month, for the next three months would allow people to pay their rent and buy groceries.
4120 4120 So this is far from over ; the current pandemic is merely threatening to pop the bubble. ( And, as we all can plainly see, the powers that be are likely running out of ways to keep the bubble inflated. ),.
4121 4121 that would be a loss for the whole country.
4124 4124 We stand by our decision to oppose this merger. If the ACCC won 100 % of the cases we took it would be a sign we were n't doing our job properly ; by only picking ` safe' cases and not standing up for what we believe in.
4130 4130 We are encouraged by the willingness of all parties and the determination of all parties to reach a solution which avoids examinership or liquidation.
4131 4131 A value of $ 507.6 billion seems huge to individuals unfamiliar with large economic magnitudes ( such as GDP ) and appears to have most journalists virtually fainting from fright,.
4134 4134 social unrest and violence, if the government did not immediately act to help.
4137 4137 There is demand, strong demand for homes in price ranges that can be reasonably purchased by people based on their local incomes,.
4139 4139 My office had to inform the police about any event he might be present at, including the General Election count, as we had no idea whether or what kind of threat he might pose.
4141 4141 Much as we have the right to demonstrate but there is need to respect the law and the rights to property of others. Those that will emerge winners must celebrate with dignity and those that will lose should also accept the results,.
4142 4142 MCP monitors led by [ Elsehower ] Mkaka, Chimwendo [ Banda ], [ Silvesetr James ] Ayuba and others also had an audience with me where they intimidated me that I should not announce the results and if I go on there will be blood in the country. I confronted Ayuba who later knelt down and appologized, so too with Chimwendo,.
4148 4148 It takes off the table having to talk about comprehensive reforms that would be in lieu of the ACA, and that I think is probably to their benefit,.
4151 4151 We need the optimism that we see now in Ukraine to be sustainable. We do not look at the latest growth numbers as an indication of success, but we have to look at how the culture is changing,.
4152 4152 We would be lucky to have any resources left to produce output, let alone expand it.
4158 4158 There is no need for a merger as the Civil Defence has been working efficiently despite limited resources. The government should instead try to strengthen the organisation by providing the required funds and facilities for its betterment,.
4160 4160 This unnecessary, selfish behaviour is seriously affecting older Australians and I ask people when they go the shops, to spare a thought about just who is missing out on essential items if you are stockpiling. ` It is now up to everyone to do the right thing.
4163 4163 if I have done anything wrong, please forgive me, I also forgive those hurt me.
4166 4166 can kiss the 2020 economy goodbye and into next year,.
4170 4170 If everyone 's knowledge were identical to everyone else 's, no one would have to communicate at all. That men do communicate demonstrates that they must assume that their knowledge is not identical.
4172 4172 So, cutting OPR is very important and it would cushion the impact of this outbreak of the virus,.
4173 4173 no reason I should have gotten it this bad.
4176 4176 Equity markets are looking increasingly exposed to near-term downward surprises to earnings growth. While a sustained bear market does not look likely, a near-term correction is looking much more probable.
4182 4182 With the central bank warning that the economy will suffer a ` temporary but substantial decline' and the rouble stabilising, monetary easing is increasingly likely. We expect 100bp ( basis points ) of rate cuts over the coming months,.
4183 4183 Everyone here must be part of this vision to work together and achieve our goals.
4187 4187 Pretty early on we realized that if this virus came to Boston and came to our campus that we would need to at least plan for doing it,.
4203 4203 The police told us to go to Ladies Park on CIT Road or to Park Circus. But we have told them that we would want a place in Esplanade,.
4204 4204 There 's a lot. The list just keeps growing by day. If you really stop to think about it, I literally would not sleep. That 's how much has to get done. But honestly, we feel as you look at it, and take a step back, where we are, is where we need to be. As long as we continue on this pace, I will sleep well the night of Feb. 2.
4209 4209 You used to do stuff by hand. Now, we need workers who can manage the machines.
4210 4210 getting it right in Sudan has a strategic impact and effect, you can imagine the spillover effect in the entire region ... what we would like to see is our friends and partners working with us in making this a success story.
4212 4212 If there are 47,173 suicides then a 3.4 percent reduction would correspond to 1,603 fewer deaths each year,.
4213 4213 No private equity firm who 's valuing a business to buy the whole business looks at whether it 's low price-to-book,.
4219 4219 It is a massive drop -- and with the depreciation of the rand against the dollar, it might well be more than that,.
4220 4220 Our model abstracts from various forces that might affect the long-run performance of the economy,.
4223 4223 Africa needs massive private capital investment to enable us drive the sectors that will develop the economy, especially sectors like power. Access to electricity is very critical if we are to develop our continent. We have a huge youth population in Africa and I think that is our biggest resource as a continent. So, in order to talk about the development of our continent, we must prioritise this segment and focus on how to empower them.
4226 4226 Let 's try to be considerate and compassionate toward each other in every possible way we can.
4231 4231 In the absence of these monetary policy measures, the euro area 's development would have been much weaker,.
4232 4232 We should also think whether we want to formulate this target in a clearer manner. It is foremost about how we can best reach the prime target, which is price stability. This is the objective that should guide us.
4242 4242 adult citizens should have a right to a certain amount of education.
4248 4248 Our head of food inspection called the editor printed this news. The man apologized. We told him, you spread this all across Turkey ! If you are the one who spread the news, tell us who these ( adulterers ) are. Our inspection teams are ready. But he just said no.
4250 4250 This variation across the country suggests that provinces and territories can learn from others' experience when it comes to holding the line on spending and shifting care to more cost-effective channels,.
4254 4254 If they 're making their money out of promoting the company that pays them the most money, consumers have got to know that,.
4255 4255 We continue to urge state and territory governments to assess individual gas development applications on a case-by-case basis. We also suggest they actively manage tenements to prevent ` warehousing' of gas, and that they coordinate the development of pipeline and storage infrastructure to avoid unnecessary duplication.
4260 4260 We brought this case because we consider that Trivago 's conduct was particularly egregious. Many consumers may have been tricked by these price displays into thinking they were getting great discounts. In fact, Trivago was n't comparing apples with apples when it came to room type for these room rate comparisons,.
4261 4261 New home sales are likely to fall drastically in the coming months as potential buyers hunker down in the homes that they want to move out of,.
4262 4262 So overall, it could be a very bad year for the U.S. economy,.
4264 4264 However, the Fed and other policymakers face an even bigger challenge. They must ensure that the economic damage from the pandemic is not long-lasting.
4265 4265 The potential benefits of retaining employees during episodes such as the current pandemic seems to represent are especially large,.
4267 4267 Today, we see as never before the risks faced by countries with inadequate health care unable to respond to emerging threats. The crisis in Russia could be less severe if we had, for example, a more advanced system for diagnosing diseases,.
4277 4277 The central bank has always been in the market during good times or bad times, during capital outflows from coronavirus that affected market stability,.
4279 4279 Where paid sick and family leave is not among standard benefits, governments should consider funding it to allow unwell workers or their caregivers to stay home without fear of losing their jobs during the epidemic,.
4282 4282 can lift confidence and support financial markets.
4287 4287 ` I 'm just glad I can afford to quadruple down,' Mr. Icahn said.
4288 4288 We are pleased to have reached this settlement and can now focus on working with Steve Chazen to enhance value for all Oxy stockholders.
4295 4295 strongly suggest that claims will fall again next week, to perhaps 3.5 mln.
4296 4296 It 's too early at this point but it all depends on how the global pandemic plays out and whether we get another credit crisis.
4299 4299 All we can say with any confidence at this point is that if markets remain at or close to their current levels, you should expect to see an abrupt deterioration in business and consumer sentiment over the next couple of months,.
4300 4300 The coronavirus is likely to start hitting job growth very soon, as hiring is scaled back and layoffs rise,.
4304 4304 There will be a period where racing will more than likely have to stop,.
4305 4305 No one needs to spend the day at the beach or the weekend touring around regional Victoria. This will only spread the virus and more people will die,.
4306 4306 The T20 World Cup is going to be an amazing event and the anticipation is building for what should be a globe-stopping final at the MCG.
4308 4308 Typically what 's happened in the past is that there might be a short-term impact from an epidemic or pandemic, but in the long term, there seems to be little influence,.
4310 4310 Virtual Care is crucial for public health and to help flatten the curve of the Coronavirus' impact. We are proud to be assisting VitalTech in launching this initiative in a concerted effort to provide peace of mind and protect the health of residents in senior living communities or a home.
4311 4311 And yet once some money is dangled in front of local councils, they tend to forget their obligation to due diligence and grab it, and that seems to be the case with the pilot training school,.
4313 4313 Remember : billionaires think of gold and silver the way the unemployed think about toilet paper,.
4314 4314 After this acquisition, I think it will be hard for CoinMarketCap to stay neutral.
4319 4319 The money and resources earmarked for the National Projects, must work primarily for the Russian economy, and first and foremost go to the development of domestic machine building, and other hi-tech industries,.
4321 4321 We continue to take measures to mitigate the negative impact of coronavirus on the Russian economy, including a priority action plan .... In the coming days, a set of additional measures should be prepared that will allow us to cope with this serious threat. It includes new measures to support small and medium-sized enterprises, the construction industry, additional measures for import substitution,.
4329 4329 some people, including somebody who 's actually running for president, who think we ought to close all the nuclear plants in the country.
4332 4332 It has also protected Delaware 's three billion dollar tourism economy, which relies on these birds and the thousands of tourists they attract each year. As climate change continues to threaten entire species of birds and their habitats, we ought to be thinking of ways we can better protect them. Instead, the Trump administration is putting the interests of industry over the health of our planet and those we share it with.
4340 4340 The merger of these three insurance companies would have adverse impact on the Centre 's flagship schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana ( PMFBY ), Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana ( PMSBY ), Pradhan Mantri Jeewan Jyoti Bima Yojana ( PMJJBY ) and Pradahan Mantri Jan Aarogay Yojana ( PMJAY ),.
4344 4344 This reflects the fact that the discounts offered to lenders' standard variable rates have risen over recent years, and these discounts tend to be fixed for the life of the loan -- what might have once seemed a big discount might not be so big now,.
4345 4345 remains prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy, full employment and the achievement of the inflation target over time.
4354 4354 Increased government spending should be first directed to the health sector, tackling virus outbreaks and supporting research,.
4355 4355 However, in this globally connected economy and society, the coronavirus and its economic and social fallout is everyone 's problem, even if firms decide in the wake of this virus shock to repatriate production and make it a bit less interdependent.
4356 4356 This is a crucial time for Ireland and the focus for the incoming government should be to keep the economy on a solid track.
4365 4365 We are talking about the coming months, or I am talking about the coming months, on the possibility of further stimulus,.
4366 4366 less V-shaped than one would like.
4368 4368 We would expect world growth would be lower than it otherwise would be, and that has a knock-on effect on the UK.
4369 4369 at the minimum there would need to be an amendment.
4370 4370 The Bank of England 's role is to help UK businesses and households manage through an economic shock that could prove large and sharp, but should be temporary.
4377 4377 If evidence builds that the weakness in activity could persist, risk management considerations would favour a relatively prompt response,.
4381 4381 There could be spillover to the U.S. economy.
4383 4383 If the rest of the population knew what we knew, and knew there was no real financial constraint on government spending, then they would put too much pressure on politicians to build good hospitals and fund education.
4388 4388 We are likely to downgrade our growth projections for the world,.
4392 4392 This facility could provide about USD 40 billion for emerging markets that could potentially approach us for financial support. We also have the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust the CCRT which provides eligible countries with up-front grants for relief on IMF debt service falling due,.
4393 4393 COVID-19 is a stark reminder of how a fragile recovery could be threatened by unforeseen events,.
4394 4394 at least as bad during the global financial crisis or worse.
4395 4395 preparedness, prevention, early action ... has to get into the bloodstream of policymakers, it is, whether it is pandemics or a climate shock or geopolitical tension.
4398 4398 My top of mind this week : As trade tensions receded, we upgraded our growth projections for China for 2020 : now coronavirus puts this at risk. More uncertainty seems to be the new normal and we all need to adjust to live with it.
4400 4400 But this is not nearly enough. The private sector can do more, and I believe it will in the days ahead. Why ? Because the price of inaction is too high.
4401 4401 avoid a scarring of the economy that would make the recovery so much more difficult.
4407 4407 I think ( Fitzpatrick 's ) a good fit for our team coming back,.
4410 4410 It is unacceptable that Wetherspoons has refused to pay its 40,000 employees until it receives its Government loan-potentially in late April - after first refusing to lock down altogether. If bosses disregard employees' wellbeing then the Government should take tougher action to force compliance.
4411 4411 crucial that companies such as JD Wetherspoons and Sports Direct do all they can to ensure their workers are properly protected and get the pay to which they are entitled.
4416 4416 Turkey should and will benefit from plummeting prices as a major gas importer. The current and prospective production conditions will enable Turkey to diversify its suppliers. It has remarkably empowered the infrastructure for LNG,.
4417 4417 The situation we are witnessing today seems to have no equal in oil market history,.
4419 4419 When we look back at 2020, we may see it was the worst year in the history of oil markets and the second quarter may have been the worst of the lot,.
4420 4420 could threaten their long-term social acceptability and profitability.
4423 4423 I also deeply regret the distress and difficulties which have been caused, but given the reference to the SLCC it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.
4424 4424 I do n't agree that it was entirely inappropriate, but I would not do it again.
4428 4428 Africa needs massive private capital investment to enable us drive the sectors that will develop the economy, especially sectors like power. Access to electricity is very critical if we are to develop our continent,.
4429 4429 By July and August, most of the businesses that have n't failed will be coming back on line. The small business lending is helpful. More helpful in appearance than in practice, I think it 's going to be really hard for them to scale and get this money out there fast enough.
4430 4430 Either way the economy will suffer. We assume these financial fault lines are not severe or persistent enough to materially weaken the economy. However, this is an increasingly tough assumption to make,.
4431 4431 If Donald Trump were elected president and put in his stated policies, the United States would experience a lengthy recession, enormous job losses, much higher interest rates, and diminished long-term growth prospects.
4433 4433 If re-elected, the President will pursue more tax cuts and will not pursue significant entitlement reform,.
4438 4438 A global recession is likely if Covid-19 becomes a pandemic, and the odds of that are uncomfortably high and rising with infections surging in Italy and Korea,.
4441 4441 the economic people can do what they can to mitigate the damage.
4445 4445 Three is a long two-decade history of poaching on this OF 's premises. Since this area is insulated for outsiders three is little that outsiders can do to curb it. There is often nexus between poachers from nearby villages with some low-rung staffers of the factory, who get bush meat from the poachers.
4449 4449 In the bilateral evaluation and dispute resolution chapter, the agreement also makes it clear that, if the concerns can not be resolved, the two parties hold the right to suspend an obligation, adopt a remedial measure, or in the worst case, withdraw from the agreement,.
4455 4455 In the past five months, no meaningful political activity has taken place in Jammu and Kashmir. The Congress party wants that meaningful political activities start in Jammu and Kashmir immediately. Political tourism of taking envoys to Jammu and Kashmir should stop,.
4456 4456 we can not be seen to be insensitive to the sentiments of the majority community.
4460 4460 Economists have long thought ` the more, the better', when it comes to information,.
4461 4461 They 're just going to be more difficult to discern from the statistical victims. If you ignore the impact on quality of life -- which is potentially an immense thing that should be taken into account -- we do n't really understand what the impact of the economy on mortality.
4467 4467 The monetary policy change is the same one applied a decade ago during the Great Recession - the lowest rates combined with quantitative easing. This is an all-out measure to prevent a recession and fight the fear that is blanketing the country. It is the right policy, since the policy can easily be reversed should a vaccine be discovered or the virus goes away.
4470 4470 This cost is over and above the general crisis which was already there and would resume if the lockdown was completely lifted,.
4473 4473 The only way this lockdown can get any worse is if the ice cream vans start booting round the streets blasting Rkid 's new tunes out hehe.
4474 4474 It is gon na happen, believe you me-it 's gon na happen very f * * * * * * soon because he 's greedy and he loves money and he knows that it 's got to happen soon or it wo n't happen.
4477 4477 It wasn ´ t doing badly when he came in, that ´ s not true, but I think it ´ s done better than most of this group ( those at the WEF ) would have expected. It ´ s been a good 10 years and his 3 years probably better than expected.
4479 4479 One can only assume that Mnuchin has to deal with vastly more unpredictability from his boss than Hank Paulson ever did,.
4484 4484 The revenues and earnings for the majority of businesses over the next year or so will be extremely poor, and in some cases disastrous, but for companies with strong balance sheets, dominant market positions, and which do not need access to capital, the virus will likely only disrupt the next 12 to 24 months of cash flows,.
4488 4488 Spread the message if you agree.
4489 4489 We have done so because we believe that efforts to contain the coronavirus are likely to have a substantial negative impact on the U.S. and global economies, and on equity and credit markets,.
4492 4492 There 's something deeply problematic in the business model if you think of it as a loss leader or not a moneymaker,.
4494 4494 Given the world we find ourselves in right now, we want to help how we know best -- so we can play through this together.
4497 4497 Additional money would not be required [ for the project ] for at least two or three years.
4498 4498 If it lasts a year,.
4502 4502 But things have n't strayed too far south suggesting markets have seemingly found a tentative geopolitical risk balance. On the one hand, we are only 48 hours away from what appeared to be a full-blown U.S.-Iran war, so it 's difficult to be cheerful, especially given the existing levels of risk.
4504 4504 Our analysis suggested that overall excess capacity in the Canadian economy has increased, which will bring a degree of downward pressure on inflation,.
4505 4505 These are not knife-edge things. You need a persistent period of excess supply or excess demand in order to turn that series into a different trend line. We have n't had anything like that.
4506 4506 On the surface, there has been some improvement on this front lately, although it remains to be seen whether this will lead to a recovery of trade and investment,.
4510 4510 First our locals ( citizens ) can get fresh ( goods ) at a lower price, that is important and if there is excess ( from local consumption ) we can export, which is also important ( to the economy ),.
4513 4513 It will take time for researchers, a good many of them who are our colleagues, to understand enough about this disease to mount a reliable defense against it. Now more than ever, we must do our utmost to protect those among us who are most vulnerable, whether physically or emotionally, and to treat one another with generosity and respect.
4523 4523 Get it out of your heads, Kenya is no longer a Third World country. Your attitudes and approaches out there should not be of one from just another Third World country.
4524 4524 If you look at the [ markets ], it 's almost reminiscent of the last financial crisis. But if these firms are able to lock in money, I would say that 's sort of tentatively good news,.
4525 4525 In essence as long as the Reserve Bank does its job, GDP growth remains more or less the same.
4533 4533 To create new European debt instruments, you need either capital, guarantees or the assignment of future tax revenues and a functioning legal and administrative system. So it 's best to use the existing institutions and tools, which have successfully raised large sums of money on the market for years,.
4534 4534 Whoever works in systemically relevant professions and is dependent on rail travel should be able to do so without drawbacks,.
4538 4538 I do n't think I 've ever truly embraced [ my hair loss ], but I 've definitely reached a place of acceptance and peace,.
4539 4539 In terms of financial stability, I think that there will be an impetus to look at market-based finance and regulatory approaches so that if there is another shock then the central bank does n't have to come in and backstop everything,.
4544 4544 This remains a broad policy guide which could change in either direction from meeting to meeting in response to new developments and changing data and risks,.
4549 4549 We should be worried about emerging markets,.
4559 4559 Think about how big the unemployment shock was in 2008, and we did n't see a big realignment,.
4560 4560 You can bid on certain special items or experiences to be redeemed at a future date or some of them are retail items. All 100 percent of the proceeds, again go towards that GoFundMe. I 'm also looking into putting a charitable widget onto our retail that would benefit an organization that helps the children of restaurant workers. I 'm looking into a million different directions and things.
4563 4563 In the long-term we will still have a housing shortage, so by continuing to acquire difficult sites and addressing the barriers which have previously stopped them moving into production, we 're making sure we can deliver on the agency 's mission to accelerate the construction of new homes while addressing the short-term disruption caused by the impact of coronavirus.
4566 4566 The economy can operate with lower unemployment than we might 've thought several years ago.
4572 4572 It 's very delicate at the moment but you can take it that everybody sees that they ( UEFA ) will have skin in the game here,.
4578 4578 That big dream they had about themselves, that they were finally going to write the great American novel or become a big pop superstar, it disappears. They start to accept that their lives are probably as good as they 're going to get, and that 's OK.
4582 4582 If employment became an issue, that would definitely increase insolvency rates.
4585 4585 The reality is that Iran 's regional behavior is not going to meaningfully change until at a minimum there is a different supreme leader, and perhaps not even until there is a different government altogether in Tehran,.
4587 4587 The Iranian regime 's inadvertent murder of 176 people -- most of them Iranian -- in the tragic plane accident may limit their ability to further avenge Soleimani 's death,.
4588 4588 The results of this paper suggest that long-term exposure to air pollution increases vulnerability to experiencing the most severe COVID-19 outcomes,.
4590 4590 You may be popular initially because of politics and ideology but if the economy slows down, you will be losing your popularity,.
4592 4592 if you essentially kick the can down the road like Italy did, and you do n't do radical compulsory lockdowns,.
4599 4599 If that happens, the recession will needlessly drag on. As the government throws away its credibility, it destroys its ability to prevent an ongoing downturn.
4602 4602 Then came the excessive coughing, vomiting and diarrhoea. I could n't breathe in for more than a second without getting excruciating chest pain. That was the point that the paramedics were called to the house and I was taken to hospital. This probably saved my life. I was struggling to breath and did n't have much fight in me.
4606 4606 What if the pandemic had arrived five years after a round of successful bans on plastic bags had altered the plastics supply chain and driven the bags altogether out of ordinary, accessible production ?.
4607 4607 While keeping this important data secure and private, operators could work with governments and leading mobile Internet companies across the world to develop an electronic ` passport', and provide more precise epidemic prevention guidelines. With the ` passport' generated by this app, governments could, in a fluid and timely fashion, set travel, isolation and preventative regulations ( like, the requirement to wear a mask ) with view to the developing situation in each region,.
4609 4609 For us personally, it 's just using common sense, trying to be as smart as we can,.
4613 4613 That seems to be where the money is going,.
4619 4619 If you want to have that optimal energy recuperation together with the best possible stability, you 'd better choose EBS,.
4622 4622 Provided one went far enough, perhaps several centuries, back in time, it was obvious to everyone that violence played a part in the acquisition of most seigneurial rights, which stemmed from conquest and serfdom,.
4631 4631 I think a wage subsidy is critical at this juncture ... because we have such a significant amount of jobs losses,.
4632 4632 I think very quickly we can talk about out over a million jobs being lost. It looks like were going to get through that in very short order,.
4633 4633 I 've got to be extra careful because if I ca n't go to work I wo n't get paid. I used to do extra agency shifts, but I 've had to stop doing them because I ca n't afford to put myself at risk of catching it.
4638 4638 A ratings downgrade along with a loss of investor confidence could lead to a plummeting exchange rate and a dramatic increase in the long-term interest rates in this environment, and a substantial losses for our financial institutions,.
4641 4641 We talked about tourism and the fact that tourism has created jobs for our people and how we can manage tourism and jobs and that we can not leave anyone behind, which is the message of the SDGs.
4645 4645 I think in the U.S., we 'll have a very terrible second quarter,.
4649 4649 First, this means that the reinforcing behavior of cocaine replaces that of sex or food,.
4651 4651 The good news is that the region has strengths it can tap, but countries will have to act fast and at a scale not previously imagined.
4654 4654 Considering the relatively long life of polymer notes and their amenability to recycling, the ` carbon footprint' of polymer notes vis-à-vis paper ban notes is likely to be on the plus side. Regardless, this is one of the issues that we will study during the pilot phase, and will embark on ( using ) polymer notes on a long-term basis only if the cost-benefit calculus is decidedly positive in all dimensions.
4655 4655 Home sellers can expect to take less time to sell their home -- meanwhile, buyers still have a good amount of choice.
4657 4657 If trends of the past two decades continue for another two decades, the ` Big Three' will grow into what we term the ` Giant Three,.
4658 4658 It 's utterly tragic the way people mobilize these beliefs for violence or for harm, it 's not what these traditions at their best are meant to do,.
4662 4662 I 'm hoping I never see anything like this happen but if I do, I know what to do,.
4663 4663 It would be positive if the central bank were to also introduce a flexible foreign exchange rate, and move away from near peg.
4664 4664 I have been invited to a conference or learning tour overseas. Should I attend ? ... Should I accept donations from an individual or group ?.
4665 4665 If a constitutional order in Libya could really be achieved, perhaps even elections, then it would be a step where a legitimate government could ask the UN for a mandate,.
4668 4668 Things like the Indian Premier League must shut down. It is crazy if we continue with it,.
4670 4670 What we 've seen has been a massive explosion of the sector. It has roughly quintupled relative to the size of the economy since the 1970s, and what are we getting for that ? I do n't think that anyone can say with a straight face that we 're getting better served in the sense that capital is somehow being better allocated, or that we 're more secure in our savings.
4674 4674 I felt bad because every time I saw the box, I drew all over it. ` Can we try this ? Can we try that ?.
4675 4675 In contrast, the same moves have, if anything, negative long-term impacts on children who are more than 13 years old when their families move, perhaps because of the disruption effects of moving to a very different environment. The gains from moving fall with the age when children move, consistent with recent evidence that the duration of exposure to a better environment during childhood is a key determinant of an individual 's long-term outcomes.
4680 4680 The changes accelerated by the 4IR are so profound that, from the perspective of human history, there has never been a time of greater promise or potential peril.

4687 4687 If you look at the hydrogen transport market in New Zealand, of course there is none. There are no hydrogen trucks because there 's no hydrogen supply for transport, and there 's no hydrogen supply for transport because there 's no trucks demanding it.
4688 4688 The lessons we learn from this outbreak should enable us to respond to infectious disease emergencies more quickly and effectively in the future.

4697 4697 We 're bailing out workers and companies as best as we can -- but the hit to state budgets is going to be enormous. While there 's some money included for states, we 're going to need much more of it.

4713 4713 I would like to ask the government if a person is not safe in the library, where else is he or she is safe ? I would like to ask the Delhi Police what was my crime. I have filed a compensation case worth Rs 1 crore against the Delhi Police,.

4732 4732 I think the coronavirus is generating some really important conversations because obviously if the coronavirus passes, we 're still going to be left with very inadequate legislation or unwell workers,.
4733 4733 I think the film turned out spectacular, but it did n't even get to the point where I was really fighting for that role at all. It was more that they wanted a professional fighter for that role.

4745 4745 The impact of the coronavirus on earnings may well be underestimated in current stock prices, suggesting that risks of a correction are high,.
4746 4746 What normally would have been done in one or two days takes five or six days.
4747 4747 A lot of the young fellas have got the shame factor around it, but that 's a part of life. There 's going to be things in your life that you might think is embarrassing, but we tell our young people just come here, try your best, and do n't sweat the little things,.
4753 4753 I think it would be much more costly,.
4754 4754 It is unfortunate, but some people equate high fees to class and they feel they can show their class only when many people can not afford the same education as their children.
4756 4756 The approval of this emergency financial tool, would provide financing in support of policies that would direct funds swiftly to Haiti 's most affected sectors, including the healthcare system, to bolster the initial response to COVID-19,.

4759 4759 synchronised or, even better, coordinated measures to protect the world economy.
4760 4760 It is now clear that we have entered a recession as bad or worse.
4762 4762 a recession at least as bad as during the global financial crisis, or worse,.
4763 4763 After a synchronized slow down in 2019, we expect a moderate pick up in growth this year and next year, we already see some tentative signs of stabilization. Recent data suggest that trade and industrial output are bottoming out. But we have not reached a turning point yet. We are revising slightly downwards. The reality is global growth at present is sluggish.
4764 4764 The moment it became clear it is no more just about China and maybe a small number of countries in Asia surrounding China, then the outlook on what the impact could be changed.
4769 4769 First, because we have a pope that is very caring and well-respected by people of all religions and who has demonstrated in his own life that high standing and modesty can go hand-in-hand,.
4770 4770 I really hope that all policymakers everywhere would be thinking about [ reducing uncertainty ]. It is tough as it is, let 's not make it any tougher,.
4777 4777 As long as interest rates remain very low, as we 've seen, and we get the recovery we 've projected, then the combination should help in bringing debt levels down slowly over time.

4785 4785 failing to take care of the planet would mean not taking care of ourselves.
4786 4786 Clean up has to be undertaken on an emergency basis, otherwise sense of confidence which is needed in our NBFC, private banks and even in our state-owned banks that would be missing, that means financial sector can not contribute to the growth,.

4788 4788 These are things that they can change if attention is paid to them and appropriate actions are taken,.
4790 4790 I just do n't know if a rate cut or an [ economy-wide ] cash handout, which are very blunt instruments, are going to change the underlying dynamic, which is people not spending,.
4791 4791 I think NSW has got the mix right. Everyone else is lagging to some extent,.
4794 4794 It 's mostly the fact that some countries really are not good places to produce, and if you can just move the talent to places that are good for production, you enrich not only the immigrant but the world,.
4797 4797 One of the positive things social media does is it can connect people who otherwise might not have come into contact with each other, so I thought it was quite nice to replicate that in the casting.

4816 4816 We will have also a worse case because we may well see that this situation may go global beyond China and this may well affect energy markets, especially oil markets, substantially,.
4821 4821 We should make sure that [ after the coronavirus crisis ] the global economy goes up but emissions go down. We can do that by providing the elements of clean-energy transitions in these stimulus packages.
4823 4823 We may well see CO2 emissions fall this year as a result of the impact of the coronavirus on economic activity, particularly transport,.
4825 4825 Some sort of price stabilization measures is inevitable should Brent crude prices continue falling.

4842 4842 By one way or another, we got changed over to vegetarianism possibly in view of the impact of Jainism and Buddhism.

4844 4844 Though it is a fact that people are agitated across the country over the Citizenship ( Amendment ) Act and the National Register of Citizens, they are raising their voice against polarization.

4847 4847 The political agenda should be a one-point mandate that ultimately brings people together, but the last voting has shown that people have lost their trust in leaders.
4849 4849 There 's gon na be an enormous loss or what economist call a deadweight loss as a permanent loss of activity that we ca n't recover. The fact is that the thing that 's not happening now wo n't then be caught up or triple time in the period when the thing is over. So if you miss going out to a restaurant once a week in the second quarter you 're not gon na go out 13 nights in the third quarter. Some of that activity is gone for good,.
4851 4851 Firms appear to have met demand by running down inventory, but that ca n't go on forever, and imports have now begun to mean-revert,.
4852 4852 The broadening of the global outbreak outside the big four is disconcerting, and the patterns seen in the initial outbreaks suggests that yesterday 's dip in the total number of worldwide new cases will prove temporary,.
4855 4855 But imagine if it 's Friday when the jobs report comes out and it 's worse than we 've ever seen. Then you 'd see Congress act with urgency. The question is if they act with urgency ahead of the terrible numbers.
4856 4856 I think the market understands that its Fed, with its hundreds of economists, has really started to think about the numbers coming in and is really sure they 'll be terrible, which is why they did this extraordinary action.
4857 4857 Government hospitals will run out of beds in rural India even if only 0.03 % of the rural population is hit by the virus,.
4860 4860 The positive thing is that while this has been a very sudden and dramatic drop in jobs and employment, things could very quickly improve once we get past the necessity of staying at home.
4863 4863 To some extent, markets are used to turbulence in the Middle East. It usually hurts global confidence, growth and markets only if it drives up oil prices significantly on a sustained basis. While we have to watch the risk, we do not expect this to happen,.
4865 4865 They are less likely to dramatically cut their consumption. That limits the overall economic damage,.
4866 4866 We can appreciate the intent of those congressmen who are currently trying to put some kind of limit on the Federal Reserve,.
4870 4870 The organization has some timelines and we have to work quickly if we want this to come to Barrie,.

4877 4877 I believe it 's dis-inflationary. I do n't believe it 's deflationary. I think we have the tools to keep the economy out of deflation and to support the economy through this challenging period.
4878 4878 If developments emerge that, in the future, trigger a material reassessment of our outlook, we will respond accordingly.
4882 4882 If it costs one hundred million dollars to save a life, and we have a limited budget, it may not be not worth it. But I think the right model right now is n't that you 're trading lives off against better economic performance. It 's that if you do n't save those lives, you might have even worse economic performance.
4884 4884 However, it would be foolhardy to claim that the recession in 2020 or 2021 was a surprise. Although recessions are not controlled by CFOs, the impact on their firm is, to a large degree, managed by the CFO. This time around, CFOs will be judged by their preparations.
4886 4886 They may have to offer a higher wage.
4888 4888 Home prices remain stable as deals continue to happen with the growing use of new technology tools. Remarkably, 10 % of Realtors report the same level or even more business activity now than before the economic lockdown.
4892 4892 It would be productive if other jurisdictions that potentially will have mandatory disclosure standards ... used more conventional routes than legislation, such as securities regulations or listing standards. Let 's have that conversation,.

4927 4927 They are being realistic. The capacity to do that sort of track and trace is probably already overwhelmed,.
4929 4929 Lacking assured like-with-like comparators in other countries, we risk making heroic, and perhaps heroically wrong, inferences country-to-country,.
4932 4932 We expect to have the first results in a few weeks, which we can feed to the government,.
4935 4935 What he says he 's going to do is what he 's going to try and do, and based on his record, he probably will get most of it done,.
4936 4936 Whilst it took place, the primary activity that takes place in December is in the retail sector and the figures and initial indications are that retail seemed to be doing realy well in December and this might have just flown from what we 've seen in November.

4941 4941 These people had no documents. They were just given a piece of paper allowing them to live in India. They could not get jobs or study in the absence of the documents. They were left to languish. Those people are now rejoicing,.
4951 4951 It does n't seem to matter how we ask [ case studies ] about well-being,.
4961 4961 even if you take those numbers at face value, which I do n't think we should,.
4964 4964 It really could happen in the next paycheck.
4966 4966 In the second half of the current fiscal year, which would be ending on March 31, we should see some bit of recovery, not a big one but certainly the second half ( of the fiscal year ) should look better than the first half,.
4967 4967 We view this package as a turning point in this crisis because it also shows a political willingness to do more later on if needed,.
4973 4973 just had a call from my brother [ Noel ] begging me to start oasis again in 2020 if you believe in life after love c'mon you know.

4983 4983 We do n't know what 's going to happen here. Get through today. Do the very best you can to help someone.
4985 4985 People were pretty upset ; this was a big deal. And I think we thought it was a big deal too. I think we were upset and they were upset. We were all upset together. I mean, you 're really upset to find out that foreign powers or anyone would have tried to interfere in the election, like, really upset.
4986 4986 Marketplace is growing nicely. It 's now used by hundreds of millions of people every month. We also rolled out ads in Marketplace, which are available in 94 markets, which means advertisers can extend their News Feed ads to Marketplace. We 're seeing a lot of interest, especially with retail and auto advertisers. It 's very early, but we 're seeing good results,.
4987 4987 There are powerful reasons to keep many of these otherwise-profitable businesses afloat during the emergency, through extensions of government credit or, as a last resort, government grants, possibly calculated as a percentage of targeted companies' past payrolls,.
4988 4988 I also noticed that when I was struggling, and I was looking at all my mentors, there 'd be little snippets here and there like, ` Oh, this person is sober' or ` This person 's sober.' And that would give me a lot of hope.
4992 4992 We 've got a little more go. We 're probably three-quarters of the way there,.
4994 4994 If you look at the Congressional budget projections, the debt-to-GDP ratio keeps creeping up. Nobody has plans to cut back on the debt for all that money we 're borrowing.
4995 4995 The odds are probably one in five for this year, but if you told me we had a recession sometime in the next two to three years, I would not be surprised.
4997 4997 may not have sufficient equity to justify an even subsidized extension of credit and may close,.
4998 4998 If our current forecast is realized it seems appropriate to characterize it as a novel-global recession.
4999 4999 The constraints facing central banks and the flexibility provided to fiscal authorities in an extremely low interest rate environment suggest that fiscal easing will be delivered earlier in this episode.

5003 5003 Today, just days after the president avowed his commitment to environmental protection, the Trump administration has proposed what could be the most significant effort yet to limit environmental protection.
5005 5005 But I do n't know that they should be entirely surprised. Two-thirds of the Senate actually support the Kennedy-Carper provisions.
5006 5006 This would seem to fly in the face of rational rulemaking,.
5007 5007 It depends, in part, on how well Joe performs while all of my colleagues are stuck here for the impeachment trial. If he tears it up and knocks the ball out of the park all over the early primary states, then it 's a plus,.
5010 5010 By pushing the season ticket renewal deadline back and confirming our policy if games were to be cancelled or played behind closed doors, we want to ease any concerns our loyal fans may have.

5026 5026 African countries should accelerate investments as well as the development of human capital,.
5029 5029 As firms become distressed and default rates climb higher, credit markets may come to a sudden stop -- especially in risky segments like high yield, leveraged loan, and private debt markets.
5032 5032 So I think the gas industry as a whole certainly has to carry a lot of blame for the mess. And it is a mess that we are in ; the companies that are closing down and [ then ] the trouble this is causing for Australian manufacturing and Australian jobs.
5038 5038 If minorities are tortured there and police failed or ca n't discharge their duties, it is a matter of serious concern,.
5043 5043 Mr Carter is not well, he has not been well for a very long time. At the time of these offences, he was manifestly unwell, he was trying to get help. It does n't excuse what he did but it does perhaps explain it.

5048 5048 We believe we 've done a lot there to cushion a blow. We do n't know how big the blow might be, so we 'll be looking at ways to figure out how big that blow might be and how long it might last.

5054 5054 This important analysis from MIT election researchers is the latest to show that the OAS' statements were without basis, and that simple arithmetic shows that there is no evidence that fraud or irregularities affected the preliminary results, or the official results -- the ones that actually matter,.
5055 5055 there is no doubt that Iran 's capacity to respond to the novel coronavirus has been hampered by the Trump administration 's economic sanctions, and the death toll is likely much higher than it would have been as a result.
5057 5057 Women are deemed to be so inferior when it comes to emotions because they can only act ` crazy' when showing them while men are allowed to behave like hooligans and every thinks ` oh well he 's a man so whatever.'.
5066 5066 Importantly we may be seeing some early signs that strength in housing markets is transferring through to other sectors, with dwelling approvals recording their first annual rise since mid-2018 and the value of new mortgage commitments up 5.9 per cent over the year to November, driven by a 10 per cent increase in owner-occupier commitments.
5068 5068 While it was not possible to provide an updated set of forecasts for the economy given the fluidity of the situation, it [ is ] likely that Australia [ will ] experience a very material contraction in economic activity, which [ will ] spread across the March and June quarters and potentially longer.
5074 5074 By all indications, Poland is an economic success, but Poles still travel Europe in search of better jobs. Nothing depends on us.

5098 5098 Realizing the rights of people living with disabilities to full and equal participation in economy and society is not only the right thing to do but benefits everyone in building a common sustainable world.

5113 5113 Today 's agreement will ensure the survival of football in Ireland. As an organisation, we must now remain focused on the fact that failure to reach today 's historic agreement would have placed the FAI in extreme peril.
5114 5114 We must minimise business closures and job losses, and the best chance of achieving that is to minimise cash outflows from the businesses,.
5115 5115 It has been a difficult journey to get to this place, where we can finally heave a sigh of relief knowing that Irish football has a secure future. Today we are delivering for all those who depend on football for their livelihood, as well as those who play, coach, volunteer, support or just love to support the game. That 's a lot of people.

5157 5157 First, there was a growing demand for African scholars to be on the forefront of the studies of their respective countries and thus break the stronghold on the analysis of African reality by researchers elsewhere. If Africa was to be developed, it was incumbent upon African scholars that a large part of our understanding of our societies should be generated from within Africa ... One of the most humiliating experiences of African scholars is witnessing intellectual ` debates' on their countries in which nationals are only marginally engaged, if at all.

5162 5162 It is like throwing a drop in the ocean for many while you could have used that amount to cure the injuries of only a few.
5164 5164 Either China massively increases imports and reduces current account surplus from the current 1.5 per cent of GDP ( gross domestic product ), or it engages in trade diversion away from current providers of goods which compete with the US,.
5168 5168 We 're exploring the switch, but it 's not a simple process. For other products like apparel, this shift might be easier, but there are so many technical components in shoes, it 's difficult to co-ordinate shifting all those suppliers to another country while maintaining quality.
5172 5172 The answer is because, by the time people figured out what was going on, they were overrun with this enormous caseload ... One of the real tragedies in China is that so many healthcare workers have been infected and in some cases have died. But if you start at the beginning, and it 's a small outbreak, and you recognize that 's what it is quickly, and you can put these things into practice, then my calculations suggest that it is definitely containable.
5173 5173 the only airline that we 're very keen to invest in in India, once the atmosphere exists that we could invest and be able to benefit from the synergies that these two airlines, Qatar Airways and IndiGo, will provide.
5175 5175 We have requested for the honorary citizenship of Pakistan for Daren Sammy. The application is currently at President 's table. I request the PCB chairman to put in a good word for Sammy, so it can be approved. Sammy 's voice notes were too emotional for Pakistan when PCB was trying to hold the PSL season 2 finale in Lahore,.
5176 5176 Another thing is communities can learn from each other,.
5177 5177 be sustainable, as once demand was destroyed, prices would fall back again only to tee up for another spike, as we have seen the last year,.
5180 5180 The biggest challenge is obviously lab classes. We have to work with teachers and faculty as to what we can do to best do alternative instruction in those cases.
5184 5184 The reason it was so important we did a randomized, controlled trial, is that if you just look at the individuals in the intervention group, it would look like the program caused a huge reduction in readmissions. But when you look at the individuals in the control group -- who were eligible for the program but were not randomly selected to get it -- you see the exact same pattern.
5186 5186 But a coordinated fiscal stimulus on the expenditure side, and individually targeted at a national level, that would be a good thing.
5187 5187 But ultimately we have capacity problems getting the money into the hands of the small businesses fast enough, without fraud or bad actors effectively figuring out how to siphon money off.
5188 5188 If [ sellers ] miss the fall market or it 's getting late in the fall market, I encourage them to go on in January because, especially uptown, everyone shuts things down and gets into holiday mode,.
5193 5193 This is consistent with the falls in bond yields and hightened growth risk. This is likely to continue until inflation and growth expectations tart to inflect higher. When that happens, we should expect a strong rotation in leadership.
5195 5195 Before the resurgence of neoliberalism in the 1970s, Australian governments accepted responsibility for maintaining full employment, and provided support for all those unable to engage in paid work, whether through age, disability or unemployment on an equal basis.
5196 5196 Evidence is evidence, whether words, numbers, images diagrams, still or moving. It is all information after all.
5197 5197 If you think about it as an equation, [ private vehicle ownership ] is a variable that has not been in the conversation, and it 's something that should we be considering as we think about what is the best way to provide transportation options to the public,.
5198 5198 The birdlife is just outstanding. The birds do n't seem to be too upset at all,.
5200 5200 I thought he was coming over, as he has for the last 10 years, to quietly get things done.
5204 5204 It 's a huge change from yesterday. By this time we would have normally sold at least $ 300.
5209 5209 If the Fed increases the rate that they 're paying banks to hold reserves, it 's going to reduce the incentive for banks to lend out funds,.
5214 5214 If you think that this is going to have a happy legacy for international relations, think again.
5219 5219 The government alone can not deliver the resources we need to win the fight against extreme poverty. At the moment, Nigeria is the poverty capital of the world. We must create multiple entry points to allow local and global influencers come together and make a difference. Innovative financing models, creative partnerships and new technology is what this movement to end poverty must deliver.
5222 5222 If you 're in a window, there 's obviously now two seats on one side of you. And so you 've cut down that zone of risk by actually six people -- because the people in front of them and behind them.
5225 5225 It 's very, very hard to know the required amount as no one has ever seen a supply-induced recession or depression,.
5226 5226 less was done in the six years of the NDA on privatisation than might otherwise have been possible.
5227 5227 One of the first things the BJP government tried to do on coming to power was to capture the universities. They put handpicked people from the RSS as vice-chancellors in a whole range of universities -- JNU, Santiniketan .... The idea was they would infiltrate the teachers' association, the students' union .... The person who was selected as VC of JNU used to run shakhas at his home.
5233 5233 If food is an essential component to our lives, given that we 're about a month from the most critical weekend for gardening -- Victoria Day weekend -- I would certainly recommend that the federal government encourage provinces to make garden centres an essential service,.
5239 5239 ... the respondent very well or ought to have known that I ceased to be a board member of UniBank since 2009 when I was appointed into a ministerial position and that I had no connection whatsoever with the collapse of UniBank in 2018.
5241 5241 In the circumstances of the virus and given that government policy has actually led to the position these airlines are in ... then I think there is a case for saying we can provide some short-term debt assistance,.
5243 5243 Leaving out the provision of 10kg food grains for households excluded from the PDS ( the public distribution system ) for which no exclusive provision had been made so far, the cost of relief measures listed in the CM 's letter would barely add up to Rs 50 crore, less than 0.1 per cent of the Jharkhand government 's annual budget,.
5252 5252 Beacon 's customers enjoy a partnership that supports their businesses at every stage, from sales to project management to job close-out. We are proud to be raising the Beacon flag in all our markets so that customers can recognize the quality products and services offered on-site and online,.
5253 5253 If there is any real substance to this deal, it is n't in the text but rather an informal commitment by China not to guide the yuan down from its already depreciated levels versus the dollar so long as the truce holds.
5255 5255 The choices that you make now can seem subtle, but they can have dramatic long-term impacts,.
5257 5257 Powell 's statement suggests to us that policymakers are assessing the impact of the damage done in markets so far before deciding how and when to act.
5262 5262 It is not a coronavirus story. That likely will come in March, when we expect to see the beginning of a serious downshift in job growth,.
5264 5264 This is not cyclical creative destruction ; it 's just destruction, and only government action can limit the disaster,.
5266 5266 We are n't worried that tariffs are about to drive up core inflation to an alarming pace. But they are making a difference in some components, and they add to the case that core inflation is much more likely to rise than fall this year.
5269 5269 Returns should be lower because interest rates are lower,.
5270 5270 We have imposed conditions on this authorisation to help minimise this risk by preventing insurers from coordinating to increase premiums, and ensuring agreements entered into under the authorisation can not last longer than necessary because of the COVID-19 pandemic,.
5272 5272 At a time of crisis such as in war or with a pandemic, where there is a common enemy to fight for the nation 's survival, and so a sense of national purpose, co-ordination is both efficient and carries little or no downside,.
5274 5274 TPG have been trying to get into mobiles since 2013 ... we think that 's a better predictor of the future than listening to the merger parties and taking your cue off them.
5276 5276 The petrol market is one we take a big interest in because the government 's given us a price monitoring role which means we 're very closely involved and obviously it 's a sector where consumers get very concerned, particularly when prices go up by 20 or 30 cents in a couple of days so that is obviously not related to costs.
5278 5278 This crisis is a supply shock that you ca n't fight with monetary or fiscal policy.
5280 5280 In India, there is one more level of complication. If oil prices rise to $ 80, it would worsen fiscal and trade situation. Macroeconomic policies in India are not where they should be,.
5283 5283 And what we said in our programs if they 've been downgraded after the date of the crisis they will have access to these new facilities.
5284 5284 Supply chains are very important, so to the extent that supply chains are disrupted by the coronavirus, that can show up in terms of inputs to the US economy,.
5287 5287 Of course, if developments emerge that, in the future, trigger a material reassessment of our outlook, we will respond accordingly,.
5288 5288 it may be appropriate to gradually transition away from active repo operations this year.
5295 5295 if we lose a man, we want to put a man in.
5296 5296 I think it will cause a reset of thoughts about globalisation. I think it will also reset our thoughts about too much reliance on China as a trading partner. I think that was happening before coronavirus. I think that 's how Trump got elected.
5298 5298 $ 1,000 to every adult who is a U.S. citizen or a taxpaying U.S. resident, and $ 500 to every child who meets the same criteria.
5299 5299 It will miss people. If your income gets cut in half, that does n't help you.
5300 5300 I was a key part of the negotiation that resulted in the payroll tax cut in 2011 and 2012. I continue to think it was the best we could do at the time given the political constraints. But it was far from optimal then and would be even further from optimal now,.
5303 5303 HP has n't done any great thing for the last five or six years. So I said ` In any way, put the companies together. I own stock in both of them. But I want Visentin to run it. That 's what I care about.
5307 5307 If they just take this naive approach of transferring funds, [ the government ] is missing the opportunity to provide broad benefits in the long run,.
5309 5309 The phase one deal confirms this so it would have been inconsistent for the U.S. to sign the deal and continue to call China a manipulator.
5310 5310 These data could be misused and undermine our national security. We must act and act without any further delay,.
5316 5316 We need to recognize there is a great deal of uncertainty around the nature of the virus, how exactly it is impacting China, would it spread beyond China,.
5317 5317 In this scenario, 2020 growth for China would be 5.6 percent. This is 0.4 percentage points lower than the January WEO Update. Global growth would be about 0.1 percentage points lower.
5322 5322 income and wealth inequality have reached or are near record highs,.
5327 5327 For low-income countries, we have rapid-disbursing emergency financing of up to $ 10 billion ( 50 per cent of quota of eligible members ) that can be accessed without a full-fledged IMF programme,.
5328 5328 Governments must stimulate the global economy in a coordinated fashion.
5329 5329 If you want the economy to prosper, we have to create space .... we need the boost that women can provide.
5332 5332 Businesses after this outbreak will look at how they are managing their stock and how they are organising production around the world. How taxation is impacting them and where they should locate firms to minimise disruption from natural disasters, but I think we will see a re-organisation of supply chains.
5337 5337 is n't the Black Death. Vulnerable people should be very careful. The rest ? Get on with normal life,.
5341 5341 we can not become a Kerala-centric party.
5342 5342 I have always held this view that if you want to do something on global warming, become a vegetarian,.
5347 5347 more adaptable and more resilient than they might have been otherwise.
5348 5348 Students who need to remain on campus will also receive instruction remotely and must prepare for severely limited on-campus activities and interactions.
5353 5353 Thailand and India should leverage their new land link to strengthen ties when the 1,360-kilometre trilateral highway is completed next year.
5355 5355 The world economic decline and the global Covid -19 virus attack, can last longer than we think. Hence we have to be very cautious in our planning and implementation of the Stimulus Package, during these fluid times,.
5357 5357 Appropriate actions taken by other parties, including global public health officials and fiscal authorities, would likely do more to support confidence and spending by helping to contain the spread of the virus, ensure adequate health-care services are available to the sick, speed development of a vaccine, and provide relief to workers and smaller businesses that are affected by the pullback in activity.
5358 5358 the exact kind of potential mechanisms through which the U.S. economy can be affected,.
5360 5360 Inflation is low, labor markets are strong, and the economy appears to be growing at around-trend of 2 %,.
5361 5361 Lack of liquidity in financial markets is a first-order problem that can reverberate through the financial system and the economy,.
5362 5362 I would not at this point want to take deliberate action just to try to get inflation back up,.
5364 5364 Employers could change withholding tables tomorrow,.
5366 5366 made $ 350,000 last year to infrequently write stories that generated little meaningful viewership or revenue.
5369 5369 There 's no vaccination. There 's no cure .... If I was an investor, I 'd be really nervous.
5370 5370 I do think the stock market 's going to find a bottom once we get a peak in the epidemic curve, [ there 's ] not a doubt in my mind the stock market will rally,.
5372 5372 That meant I would 've had work for four or five months out of the year, and then I 'd be able to do a movie like a Bad Boys or something like that.
5377 5377 This does n't sound like much, but it can have a meaningful psychological impact on already improving housing markets,.
5378 5378 This assessment can change on a dime in today 's uncertain world, but for now, the central bank is likely to remain on hold,.
5380 5380 That 's how the hospital system became so huge in America ... A good society would downplay that, and that 's not America.
5383 5383 This defensive exercise demonstrates the ability to rapidly move a large force from the United States to Europe to help protect other Nato Allies, if needed,.
5384 5384 Can we expect a more concrete step from the NATO ? There are three million refugees in Turkey.
5388 5388 Europe and North America are indispensable partners -- two sides to the same coin. together, we are half of the world 's military might and half of the world 's economic might.
5389 5389 The forces are in their home countries, but, then, they can move quickly, if needed,.
5393 5393 At the end of the the day, what we will have achieved if this legislation is voted through is landmark legislation that has no precedent in the country and in fact very little precedence in the world, because as far as we know, only the country of France has something similar,.
5395 5395 I think it is worth noting that the socialist on the City Council has become the most senior council member.
5396 5396 If you shut down for two weeks, then you looking at something like a -16 per cent quarter,.
5398 5398 Right now, if you have the resources, eat the same way, act the same way, minimize the social gathering to contain the virus,.
5401 5401 I think we could certainly see a 10 to 20 percent correction,.
5403 5403 It 's like if Indiana disappeared for an entire year,.
5406 5406 Lower interest rates could also encourage more borrowing by households eager to buy residential property at a time when there is already a strong upswing in housing prices in place,.
5415 5415 Rajnath Singh should advise Amit Shah to call for the Army to deal with Anti CAA violence. If Amitji agrees it will be a blow to our democratic tradition but bringing to an end this violence is as important for our democracy to survive. Anti CAA agitation is anti national,.
5419 5419 For India, macro stability is very important, which means stability on the fiscal front. That would require increasing revenue mobilisation and also rationalising expenditure.
5421 5421 The cumulative loss to global GDP over 2020 and 2021 from the pandemic crisis could be around 9 trillion dollars, greater than the economies of Japan and Germany, combined,.
5422 5422 These growth rates were lower than the population growth rate in South Africa, in terms of per capita, so these are numbers we would hope are much better, the growth would be much higher than this,.
5427 5427 We even have import-export data, so we can surf through the entire economy to track the value-added chain from origination to final sale,.
5430 5430 I believe in a few years' time, when you look at 2020, we may well see that it was the worst year in the history of global oil markets,.
5432 5432 Monday 's meeting with OPEC + countries can well be a good start, but even the numbers people are talking about may not be enough to find a solution to the problem. It would only help to mitigate the damage we are seeing.
5433 5433 We have an important window of opportunity. Major economies around the world are preparing stimulus packages. A well designed stimulus package could offer economic benefits and facilitate a turnover of energy capital which have huge benefits for the clean energy transition,.
5437 5437 Whether if it 's a yes or a no .. Our voice needs to be heard. It 's an interesting time. Hopefully, we can get his done. If you asked me, it is a pretty good deal. It is. Is it a perfect deal, no .. But I 'm hard-pressed to find such a thing as the perfect deal.
5439 5439 If you paint a perception through the media that the Beltline is a fun, active place to go, you 'll get residual benefit off of that,.
5443 5443 There should be fifty shades of green, if not more.
5444 5444 Extreme weather events damage infrastructure and private property, negatively affect health, decrease productivity and destroy wealth .... If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist.
5447 5447 could support a more resilient payments landscape.
5449 5449 I accept that in other jurisdictions they can work, but I 'm feeling fortunate that at least it looks like I 'm going to get out without having negative rates,.
5453 5453 As we approach the 50th anniversary of the Environmental Protection Agency and EPA proudly touts its ` progress for a stronger future,' President Trump has again proposed to slash the agency 's budget by almost a third. I would hardly call that ` progress for a stronger future,.
5455 5455 Not only will this not address the challenges along our southern border, but diverting these funds appropriated to the Department of Defense will impact the readiness of our National Guard and make Americans, and our military, less safe. If President Trump is serious about securing the border, he should work with Congress to build upon the smart investments made by the Obama administration to address the root causes of irregular migration at the U.S. southern border -- rather than raiding funding dedicated to our military and National Guard.
5456 5456 The American Energy Innovation Act presents the Senate with a rare opportunity to legislate, and with that comes an even rarer opportunity to enact bipartisan policy that would meaningfully address climate change while supporting American workers and businesses,.
5457 5457 Even if the only nominee this president has nominated to the board -- Katherine Lemos -- is confirmed before then, the board will again be left with only one member in August when Kristen Kulinowski 's term expires.
5459 5459 The apparent absence of EPA authorship of its own Clean Air Act vehicle greenhouse gas emissions rule may be unlawful,.
5468 5468 If we do not take right decisions, it is likely that we would also fail,.
5471 5471 reconsider non-essential personal or business travel away from Dane County.
5472 5472 suggests a design flaw on the part of the government 's program.
5473 5473 The borrower feels the impact. If it 's for consumption then there is less consumption, if for investment then there is less investment. We 're basically running the IMF program. As things stand we are meeting all the indicators and targets given to us,.
5474 5474 The climate that seems to hang over the heads of state and government and the lack of European solidarity pose a mortal danger to the European Union,.
5475 5475 The Fed has not used new tools other than QE and forward guidance, but, within the bounds of its legal authorities, it should not rule out other options,.
5477 5477 There 's Inglourious Basterds and then there 's Munich, right ? I did n't feel like people would want to be coming back to watch Munich every week,.
5478 5478 Wanting to gain vengeance can be Jewish, too. It 's the idea of people who 've been so otherized and persecuted for so long reclaiming power that is so political.
5480 5480 This is a show about vigilantes who reclaim their power and asks the question ` If you hunt monsters, do you risk of becoming a monster yourself ? It 's a timely idea we should be asking ourselves in this day and age,.
5486 5486 I had to separate a man and his wife as she was coming the department and she was wailing in pain and he had to stop he could n't come back,.
5494 5494 And basically I started pelting my dad with tennis balls which was, I think exhilarating for both of us. I think it was a real bonding experience.
5496 5496 I do n't know why he would want to come to the Dolphins, we 're a team trying to build for the future,.
5498 5498 I do n't think people have thought efficiently or carefully about smart strategies that would get the best of both, and make a better trade-off between the two. I say that as someone who is 64, and who might be -- as part of a smart strategy -- isolated,.
5499 5499 If each bank and the other banks in the system ease their credit policy even slightly, it will help in overcoming the cash flow difficulties that may weigh down on healthy economic activity, and the economy will weather the intermediate period,.
5502 5502 It can also result in people being left unprotected or more vulnerable to the virus.
5503 5503 No monetary, fiscal or regulatory policy response can tackle the health emergency and contain the direct economic fallout from ever-tighter lockdowns. No single such statement may suffice to break the circuit in equity markets. But within the realm of what monetary policy can do, the ECB is now seriously tackling the two key issues facing economic policymakers : easing the liquidity crunch in the economy and helping governments to finance their response to the health emergency.
5508 5508 I think he wrecked rural Ireland and he was aided and abetted by two political parties,.
5515 5515 I absolutely would not want anyone to get this,.
5521 5521 This is under threat if new trade agreements fail to preserve our internationally recognised high standards -- this is where there 's a risk that the Agriculture Bill will back-fire.
5522 5522 Our exporters should be taking advantage of these lower rates. It is about taking the risk out of profit margins.
5525 5525 At this stage, we think the balance is still more in favor of this being an event-driven bear market, suggesting that the rebound in equity markets will be swift, but from a lower level,.
5526 5526 If you have a spending problem, maybe you should err towards the side of the no fee, no frills card so that you 're not incentivized to spend more money.
5530 5530 With more and more people physically distancing to slow the spread of COVID-19, staying in touch with loved ones can be difficult,.
5531 5531 I love you so much and could n't be more excited about spending the rest of our lives together.
5534 5534 If you do this well, you 're going to be in a position to give back.
5536 5536 Are you ready to make a profound shift in your well being, identity, relationships and effectiveness ? As men, we are called to ` toughen' or ` roughen' up. We are told we really ca n't be emotional or show our emotions. Anything that goes against this idea of ` manliness' deems you a wimp or sissy.
5538 5538 If trade [ and ] other uncertainties do n't get resolved it could lead to wholesale retrenchment among businesses.
5540 5540 They must not benefit from this crisis.
5542 5542 ... a more favourable credit growth environment should boost activity, creating more business demand for borrowing,.
5543 5543 Demand side inflation -- as evidenced by Non-food, non-fuel inflation -- is muted. Our future concerns are around the likely impact of pressure on food prices, given the headline-grabbing locust invasion,.
5545 5545 Instead of stress reduction workshops or meditation, reduce stress,.
5546 5546 If there 's the same amount of damage being done, it 's kind of weird that we would hold one set of agents much more responsible and judge them more harshly than another set of agents.
5547 5547 I would n't ever say there is anything difficult about it,.
5549 5549 bottom-line, my-way-or-the-highway charismatic CEO is as likely to be the most emotionally stunted, attention-craving, socially maladroit, casually cruel, spectacular boor in the room.
5550 5550 It may hopefully be true that it will be less stigmatizing in this situation, where we have so many more people becoming unemployed for reasons that are clearly no fault of their own.
5551 5551 It will help some, and may put a floor under inflation and interest rates. But fiscal stimulus and direct help for affected sectors is necessary to get recovery,.
5553 5553 We estimated that Kurzarbeit had a significant impact on preserving jobs during the global financial crisis, with employment in the second half of 2009 estimated to have been 580, 000 higher than what it would have been in its absence.
5555 5555 When somebody moves from California to Dallas, they may live a better life. Will they have the same impact they would have had had they been in California ? I 'm not so sure.
5559 5559 Our season is ending. All the fruit is already on its way or is there. The vast majority of it has already been marketed, so there should n't be any major problems,.
5560 5560 Personally, I think it 's been a close call, therefore it does n't take much data to swing it one way or the other,.
5563 5563 would n't be one bit surprised.
5565 5565 Many businesses in my community no longer have flood insurance because it would make their businesses unviable.
5566 5566 Every market will go through a cycle. I would say right now, out west in Alberta and B.C., because they 've had their first death and there have been several cases there, they actually did go through a cycle of panic buying,.
5568 5568 Canadians should take everything into consideration,.
5571 5571 All things considered, it was Governing Council 's view that the balance of risks does not warrant lower interest rates at this time. In forming this view, we weighed the risk that inflation could fall short of target against the risk that a lower interest rate path would lead to higher financial vulnerabilities, which could make it even more difficult to attain the inflation target further down the road,.
5572 5572 Consumer and business confidence could be set back for a longer period of time, causing economic growth to slow more persistently. This could include longer-term layoffs, for example. At this point, we simply do not know.
5574 5574 I would certainly not rule out quantitative easing. Of course now. That is something that is a standard part of the central bank toolkit.
5579 5579 When this crisis came about we first made sure we were helping our clients, and then looked at which part of the community had the greatest need. This stood out as something where we could make a very quick difference for people who need it,.
5584 5584 There are asset managers that hold relatively illiquid assets like high-yield bonds or loans, and the risk is that the investors in those asset managers might decide to redeem their shares quickly,.
5585 5585 So, as the IMF or the World Bank goes into a developing country and says, ` What are your debts ?', the country ca n't tell you because they have a nondisclosure clause that 's really tightly written,.
5596 5596 If you look at the existing infrastructure channel today, everyone is building a DevOps practice to support and have something to say when talking to customers about digital transformation.
5602 5602 This recession is huge and extremely abrupt ... We could be at levels evoking the Great Depression,.
5605 5605 probably the most challenging operation our organization and team ever had to do,.
5607 5607 If you know the words, wash along.
5610 5610 ... It is too early to assess the likely impact as to whether lower interest rates can overcome the economic and health anxieties.
5612 5612 But a large price declines or persistent price declines are unlikely,.
5616 5616 There is a risk that protectionist groups on both sides could abuse the level playing field issue to undermine the free trade agreement,.
5624 5624 we would all be out of work because productivity has been increasing for two centuries.
5626 5626 If we move the calendar year to July or August, they will be extending all the way to summer next year. Our schools are not really built for summer classes,.

5631 5631 Whoever makes a present of his own armory to a foreign army is called a traitor all over the world, I am just calling a spade a spade. He can not even temp to file a lawsuit.
5635 5635 We expect Bank Negara Malaysia and other financial authorities to come up with measures to ease pressure on the market and the ringgit, although such moves could bring some repercussions at the initial stage.
5636 5636 About 500 billion yuan of liquidity could be injected.
5639 5639 Today, our specialists from Rospotrebnadzor and the Ministry of Health, a total of six people, arrived in China to discuss the coronavirus infection issue with our counterparts, assess the situation, understand what is happening and what additional measures we could take to protect our citizens,.
5640 5640 If they feel that their skin is irritated it can help to use moisturisers that contain ceramides, squalene, niacinamide, or hyaluronic acid that may rehydrate the skin and also serve as a barrier for the skin to protect it,.
5643 5643 This should be a debate addressed to fiscal policy makers.
5644 5644 In Medallion 's situation they 're probably not taking larger bets -- they 're taking small bets that are all about the same in terms of profitability,.
5645 5645 It 's hard to imagine anything worse. Putting up public money to support an industry that serves the rich would be hard to justify. It 's absurd.
5646 5646 Construction was likely helped by better-than-usual January weather,.
5647 5647 One needs to keep in mind however that the minimum wage was introduced when the German economy was doing well. Our findings do not necessarily generalise to other labour markets, or other time periods.
5655 5655 But if additional support is required for the banking sector, the government will do it. All of this assumes, however, that the current measures have failed,.
5660 5660 I think the level of inequality we have today is not only unfair but it is also not efficient for the working of the economy,.
5667 5667 I found it in Europe, Asia, North and South America, in Australasia and Africa ... There were very few countries I did not find it for, and that happened mostly where there were small samples or I had no data.
5675 5675 The key is what can we do to make sure that we accelerate the recovery ?.
5678 5678 I thought, this is the cutest guy I 've ever seen in my life,.
5687 5687 We 're not trying to say that cars are bad or that we do n't need roads. We 're just trying to say that if we think about the overall cost/benefit analyses around transportation when it comes to this conversation, not only is there a cost to the vehicle economy, but the cost is actually larger than we may have realized.
5688 5688 Why does indexing outmaneuver the best minds on Wall Street ? Paradoxically, it is because the best and brightest in the financial community have made the stock market very efficient. When information arises about individual stocks or the market as a whole, it gets reflected in stock prices without delay, making one stock as reasonably priced as another. Active managers who frequently shift from security to security actually detract from performance ( vs. an index fund ) by incurring transaction costs.
5689 5689 If he wo n't, keep it in the act.
5691 5691 There has been something very sad as well as very grim about dealing with this. Even just a few years ago I would never have imagined being involved in a court case where a local candidate or officer in another political party had made threats of violence. Politics needs to be better than this.
5693 5693 We appreciate that regulators and agencies have an obligation to investigate ; if any information is sought from us, as a responsible corporate citizen, we will of course provide the same. While it is unfortunate that I was unable to go in person to the Directorate of Enforcement ( ED ), our senior authorised representative did attend in person with the requisite information. Needless to say, if in the future any assistance or support to the investigation is requested from us, we will cooperate fully.
5697 5697 Our aircraft have already played important roles during crisis management events such as wildfire containment. Our airborne sensors can see through thick smoke, enabling us to inform ground personnel about the locations of fire lines so they can deploy resources efficiently. The demonstration highlighted how the aircraft can be used for many other civilian and commercial missions.
5700 5700 The German league is one of the most solid in Europe and perhaps even the world. If we can follow through on this last step towards professionalization, especially in terms of management, then this league could be what it is meant to be : the best in the world with an excellent fan culture that can help sustain it.
5706 5706 We know from our previous engagement with companies on climate change just how important BlackRock 's support can be for moving companies forward. This is a hugely welcome decision by BlackRock and a step-change for the entire investment industry as it collectively grapples ever more seriously with the financial implications of climate change.
5709 5709 It makes public what would have otherwise been illegal,.
5710 5710 People are revolting against the economic ` elites' they believe have betrayed them. With the world at such critical crossroads, this year we must ... reimagine the purpose and scorecard for companies and governments.
5715 5715 But to bring new hope to citizens, we must learn and change. Across the region, transparency can help lead to growth with enhanced trust in government in the years and decades to come,.
5716 5716 deteriorate even faster. I think the policies and fundamentals are going to go in favor of bad fundamentals, unfortunately, initially,.
5717 5717 The Magnitsky Act is an act of congress. In order to put it in place it required a majority of congress and if it was ever to be taken away, it would require a majority of congress. I know for sure that congress is not going to repeal the Magnitsky Act.
5718 5718 There are deep links between friendship and knowledge. Our intellectual horizons expand when we learn from each other. We can give to the world much more than what we get from it. Friendship is, in fact, central to the development of knowledge,.
5724 5724 The drop in claims between the December and January payrolls survey weeks likely boosted ADP 's number substantially, but it was due to seasonal adjustment issues over the holidays, not any real shift in the pace of layoffs,.
5725 5725 It matters because it has been the most accurate survey-based leading indicator of wage gains in this cycle, signalling shifts in the official data about a year in advance. At the peak, in November, it suggested wage growth would rise to about 5 % a year from now ; now it signals 3-3/4 % but the index is volatile, and we think it is likely to rise further over the next few months,.
5731 5731 But the margin of error at this point is deeply uncertain, and the number could be much higher,.
5735 5735 supply chains and business-to-business services presumably are being pounded now,.
5739 5739 We may be shouting with each other, but we are talking with each other.
5741 5741 In the UK, for example, the top 10 % now control nearly as much wealth as the bottom 50 %. This situation is mirrored across much of the OECD ( Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ), where income and wealth inequality have reached, or are near, record highs,.
5751 5751 the impact on the world economy would be relatively minor and short-lived.
5755 5755 It is the sheer geographic spread of the epidemic around the world ... [ and ] the additional knowledge that has been accumulated on how the virus spreads, and it is unfortunately spreading undetected more than was initially thought,.
5757 5757 global value chains ... it is affecting tourism ; it is affecting travel. What we also know is that if it is contained rapidly, there can be a sharp drop and then a very graphic rebound, what is known as a V-cure. And we are very much hoping this is going to be the case.
5764 5764 We believe this will likely lead to debasement concerns similar to the post-GFC period,.
5767 5767 We need to reverse our profit decline and return to growth so that we can invest more in our customers and in our partners. This will require a transformation in how we operate as a partnership and could take three to five years to show results,.
5770 5770 They want the government to intervene more, not less to save their specific sector or industry, With rare exceptions, even business organisations and associations, which are expected to represent the collective interest of business, have not bothered to push for pro-growth reforms,.
5772 5772 More construction will mean more housing inventory for consumers in the later months of this year ... Spring months could still be quite tough for buyers since it takes time to convert housing starts into actual housing completions.
5773 5773 Price appreciation has rapidly accelerated, and areas that are relatively unaffordable or declining in affordability are starting to experience slower job growth. The hope is for price appreciation to slow in line with wage growth, which is about 3 %.
5775 5775 Many of the home sales that are likely to be missed during the first part of 2020 may simply be pushed into late summer and autumn,.
5778 5778 Reopening cities will not be as easy as hitting a reset button that returns everything to normal in a month or two. If we want to reopen safely and securely, we have to start preparing now.
5779 5779 Suppose, your annual income is low ( i.e., in the tax exempted bracket ), you will have to bear the full burden of the education loan. You wo n't get any tax benefits.
5783 5783 The hope is that lockdown can be lifted in May and activity will begin to normalize in the early summer. But a longer period of confinement certainly seems possible,.
5785 5785 When you 're seeing wages rise for those with more skill, and stagnate, or decline, for those with less, that seems to be a signal that 's saying loud and clear we have to do a better job of equipping young people with the skills they need to succeed in the labor market,.
5791 5791 We have to see whether the Chinese will keep their word, whether they will indeed buy $ 200 billion more in U.S. products. If they do that, it might be easier to achieve a phase two deal because then liberalization in China might come easier.
5792 5792 Although our exports might suffer due to the ongoing crisis, however, the oil prices will also go down bringing a relief in payments,.
5798 5798 There are other ways of getting those kind of products if you do have to stay home for 14 days. It 's not necessary for every household in Alberta to have a 14-day stock of all critical supplies.
5799 5799 If it 's a harsh winter we could probably use 50 to 60 more. If it stays pretty mild, 30 to 40 to really get us through the winter,.
5803 5803 The Fed could ask Congress for the authority to buy limited amounts of investment-grade corporate debt ... The Fed 's intervention could help restart that part of the corporate debt market, which is under significant stress. Such a programme would have to be carefully calibrated to minimize the credit risk taken by the Fed while still providing needed liquidity to an essential market.
5805 5805 Progress in terms of outcomes, it 's too soon to say, obviously. Progress in terms of process I think has been tremendous.
5806 5806 I do n't think it 's going to be a rapid.
5810 5810 I welcome the fact that now we are looking into what more we can do.
5812 5812 We want to prevent or avoid a new arms race. Therefore, we are going to look into what more we can do related to arms control. A new arms race would be dangerous, and also extremely expensive. Therefore, we regret very much the demise of the [ Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, INF ] Treaty. We will work on new effective arms control, because that 's the best way to keep tensions down,.
5819 5819 And if I 'm being specific, I would say that black, Latinx and Native communities in America as a result of our long and persistent racial wealth gap really do n't have the economic means to withstand job loss, or even have to deal with unexpected expenses that surely will arise as a result of the pandemic,.
5822 5822 We should n't be satisfied until every young girl can move through her life without facing legal barriers to her success.
5823 5823 We 're not the ones that declare ... if the insurance is triggered,.
5824 5824 Lots of things are possible, within that we should not rule out -- perhaps even we should rule in -- the possibility of making legislative change,.
5826 5826 They have The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and now Hunters -- you can be Jewish, you can be other in a way where you used to have to whitewash those things on broadcast TV or on cable in the past. But they 've really given such a beautiful welcome to these stories about others, which is so nice.
5827 5827 She would tell me stories about her time during the war. And as a young kid, five, six years old, hearing those stories, they felt like the stuff of comic books and superheroes. And as I got older I struggled with that feeling of birthright : What was my responsibility now to continue her story ? So many Holocaust survivors are no longer with us and that community is growing smaller and smaller by the year,.
5831 5831 I think that 's very timely, I think it 's a question we should all be asking ourselves in this day and age.
5835 5835 How can we call ourselves a civilisation if we think murdering animals for a laugh is OK ?.
5843 5843 Youth unemployment must be given top priority. With 12 million graduates entering the labor market each year and only 3 million of them getting jobs, the mountain of youth unemployment is rising annually.
5844 5844 We must protect lives. This Facility will help African countries to fast-track their efforts to contain the rapid spread of COVID-19,.
5847 5847 And if the price signal is accompanied by enabling technology, they reduce their peak electricity usage even more.
5848 5848 Edelweiss has no relationship with Capstone Forex Pvt. Ltd. and all allegations of FEMA violations are false. We appreciate that regulators and agencies have an obligation to investigate ; if any information is sought from us, as a responsible corporate citizen, we will of course provide the same,.
5849 5849 Even if there was 10m b/d of cuts, in our view we could still see a building of stocks of 15m b/d,.
5851 5851 Directing funds to companies that have had 30 years to prepare for the demise of their industry is simply throwing money away when it could be put to so much better use elsewhere.
5852 5852 This welcome halt in emissions growth is grounds for optimism that we can tackle the climate challenge this decade ... We now need to work hard to make sure that 2019 is remembered as a definitive peak in global emissions, not just another pause in growth.
5853 5853 We should not allow today 's crisis to compromise the clean energy transition.
5855 5855 We can use the current situation to step up our ambition to tackle climate change ... This is a huge opportunity we can not miss. Here the issue is not only the level of [ stimulus ] money, but the direction of the money.
5856 5856 During this terrible year, the second quarter may very well be the worst of the lot and ... April may very well be the worst month.
5860 5860 With their extensive know-how on engineering, large-scale project management and with their deep pockets, those companies can play a key role in developing ... renewable options such as offshore wind and, at the same time, help key technologies such as carbon capture, utilization and storage or hydrogen to reach maturity,.
5862 5862 I do think that successful strikes in one place can give workers [ elsewhere ] more confidence in their ability to have a successful strike,.
5863 5863 There should have been really tight, hard-and-fast provisions [ in which ] the industry bailouts require that you 're keeping your people on payroll ; that you 're paying them, not just laying them off.
5878 5878 If the job market continues to perform as it is today on election day, it should be a tailwind to the president 's re-election,.
5880 5880 That is going from 2 % growth to 1 3/4 % growth. Over a period of a generation, that would make it harder to provide for a lot of the things he wants to provide.
5881 5881 If you 're in the stock market, you should have a long-term horizon,.
5884 5884 If this is devolving into a recession, there will have to be layoffs,.
5887 5887 Last week, very few people would have said BP was Paris-aligned,.
5897 5897 If you say that about a child, the effect can be transforming,.
5899 5899 They can refuse, they can also not refuse. But in our experience, they do n't refuse,.
5900 5900 Europe would have needed fiscal stimulus even without the [ coronavirus ] crisis,.
5901 5901 They have negative rates, but so what ? That just means that prices will rise and rise -- you can make a lot of money that way. And if I am wrong and equities go up by 10 % instead, that 's also okay. You have to hedge your money against a crash, that is more important.
5902 5902 Those shocks may end up being more severe than the coronavirus crisis,.
5911 5911 Why government leaders must act now to address the next recession.
5913 5913 People who really do n't have a buffer are going to spend less on everything. We could see this soon. And if we start to see consumer spending slip, then we have a big problem,.
5918 5918 The economy is still being supported by very firm private sector spending, and that is a positive development in our economy. More importantly, the private investment might turn around,.
5919 5919 Going by history, Bank Negara cuts interest rates by 25 bps each time. Is that enough in today 's scenario or will it cut more ?.
5921 5921 Did you know that microwave ovens can also reduce wifi signals ? So do n't use the microwave when you 're making video calls, watching HD videos or doing something important online. Also, place your router on a table or shelf rather than on the floor, and keep it switched on.
5926 5926 Strong policy response will allow us to manage this crisis and we have the scope and capacity to respond and we should really respond.
5927 5927 I have no doubt the European Union can deliver on regulation,.
5929 5929 There is also some part of it that has to do with weakness in rural income growth. We are expecting to see about the first half of fiscal year 2020-2021 is when we should start seeing the recovery happening,.
5931 5931 banks suspect consumers and firms may be unable to repay their loans on a timely basis.
5933 5933 There are now tentative signs that global growth may be stabilising, though at subdued levels,.
5937 5937 Cruise lines are able to freely alter their itineraries, and if you do n't have insurance, you 're just stuck, and the trouble with insurance is, it often has exceptions for pandemics and things like this.
5939 5939 If the United States had mandatory voting,.
5940 5940 If you take a poor community and you whack it on the head like coronavirus did, it really sets it out of equilibrium,.
5942 5942 In fact, many people in our communities are incredulous that we would be too worried over whether inflation was 1.6 per cent, 2 per cent or 2.2 per cent. They ask, ` Have n't you got something more important to worry about ?'.
5943 5943 It is too early to tell what the overall impact will be, but the SARS outbreak in 2003 may provide a guide,.
5946 5946 No one could have been prepared for this.
5948 5948 They 're waiting for a German response to the changing international order ; also to the increasingly likely prospect of Trump 's re-election ; to the challenges a European climate policy poses to us.
5949 5949 Coronavirus is creating a situation where, for a brief amount of time, 50 per cent or more of people may not be able to work.
5950 5950 I am in favour of placing the image of goddess Lakshmi on Rs 10,000 currency notes. Lord Ganesha removes obstacles. Indonesia has also recovered from the crisis by placing the idol of Ganesha on its currency notes. Nobody should feel bad about this,.
5952 5952 There are no inducements or force involved in Hindus getting converted to Buddhism. According to Article 25 of the Constitution, a Hindu is one who is not a Muslim or a Christian.
5954 5954 Pakistan must explain to the UNHCR the video report circulating that Sind Hindu population is being starved to death. If it is a fake video then that too be told,.
5957 5957 We continue to operate around 150 daily flights to more than 70 cities worldwide. Sometimes governments put in place restrictions that mean we simply can not fly to a country. We are working closely with governments around the world, and wherever possible we will reinstate or add more flights.
5959 5959 The Fed is not omniscient. They do n't know what the right rate should be. How could anyone ? If the success of capitalism depends on someone being smart enough to know what the rate should be on everything ... we 're doomed. We might as well resurrect Gosplan.
5961 5961 it is an extremely important discussion and we are compelled to think about that.
5965 5965 does not necessarily mean that markets can not rebound sharply,.
5967 5967 Germany wanted to send the strongest monetary economist to the ECB to shape thinking there.
5970 5970 Whether it is trying to come up with a vaccine or trying to come up with better, more accurate or faster tests, this is a transformation,.
5972 5972 at least an indication that there could be a causal relationship underlying,.
5980 5980 clearly skewed to the downside, with an increasing amount of companies suggesting potential production cuts should supply chain disruptions persist into Q2 or later,.
5982 5982 America will end as we know it. I 'm sorry to say so, unless we take this option. Hell is coming. Capitalism does not work in an 18-month shutdown, capitalism can work in a 30-day shutdown.
5983 5983 The hedge did not increase in value during or after I went on CNBC. It stayed at approximately the same value until we exited.
5989 5989 While the diversity of Indian culture can and should be celebrated, specific groups or weaker sections of society must not be dis-privileged in the process.
5991 5991 The cancellation of an allocation obtained through improper means is one thing and would not affect the investment climate. However, cancellation because the process followed by the government was judged to be improper, with no demonstrable fault of the investor, is quite another.
5992 5992 There are many protests going on right now in the streets. I frequently hear, sort of, wherein dissent is equated with disloyalty. I think that 's completely wrong. Peaceful dissent is an essential part of the democratic process. If people feel that 's not happening, then I think the government should reassure them that, you know, they are under misapprehension and live up to those standards.
5993 5993 The government should pay for it for all workers.
5995 5995 you 've maxed out on health and maxed out on targeted assistance, you have two problems : One is millions, or tens of millions, of households are going to be hurting from lower incomes, lost jobs, or time off work,.
6000 6000 This decision sends a strong message to comparison websites and search engines that if ranking or ordering of results is based or influenced by advertising, they should be upfront and clear with consumers about this so that consumers are not misled.
6002 6002 Each person has a producer and a camera operator reminding them at certain stages, helping guide them through the gameplay, sometimes helping them to articulate their thoughts. But once they 're up and running into the game -- two or three days in -- they 're flying ; they really get into the rhythm of how it works and how it plays out.
6011 6011 Why would he come to a rebuilding team ?.
6013 6013 for professional, private, study, or tourist reasons.
6016 6016 Unless it appears in his contract of employment, it indicates that there was a private agreement.
6019 6019 We have to align our strategies with modern realities of digital economy across the globe. NIPOST has very great potentials to play those roles in the new world economic order but it must position itself for that new role. That is the rationale behind our restructuring.
6021 6021 women can help improve Africa 's economic growth exponentially and that growth can in turn help Africa 's women as we seek to close the gender economic gap. We need to silence the guns now.
6025 6025 European countries have faced the same kind of technological change we have, and they 're not seeing the people killing themselves with guns or drugs or alcohol,.
6027 6027 The IMF policy should be fair in assessing and approving loan requests.
6029 6029 have been earmarked for privatization, liquidation, or merger.
6034 6034 Zimbabwe is going through a transition and you can not have silver bullet solutions. If you are going through a transition, these things ( currency reforms ) will take time,.
6037 6037 We have, as a faculty, been thinking more seriously about pedagogy in the last month than we have in the prior eight years.
6050 6050 Because I do n't think any business can be confident it can come back in the same form.
6053 6053 We think the jobs number in early April might be as much as minus a million or so because nobody is going to be hired next week,.
6055 6055 In a world of containment, in the short-term, we 'll likely see a precipitous fall in discretionary spending which will almost surely lead to job losses in ` experiential' sectors of the economy, such as the arts and entertainment, and restaurants and tourism,.
6056 6056 In a clique, everyone knows everyone and all tell you the same. The more peripheral the contact, the more likely she is to tell you something you did n't know.
6058 6058 What we 're trying to do is to position all of our analysis on our understanding of the underlying financial vulnerabilities that fuels that conversation. But I can assure you that 's not going to distract us from job one : which is to stabilize the macroeconomy and, through that, to achieve our inflation targets,.
6059 6059 This is probably one of the buying opportunities of my life time,.
6064 6064 We can not afford to put any more pressure on our hospitals and healthcare professionals at this time. Just as it is our national duty to tackle the pandemic, it is also our national duty to stay safe, keep others safe on the roads and not add to the workload of our health care system. Do n't be selfish. Do n't drink or take drugs and drive,.
6065 6065 the existing deliberations that were underway, regarding funding and the organization of graduate student programs, would have to stop, and these would be replaced by a collective bargaining process. At that point, the role of the faculty would end.
6067 6067 The supply shock itself could transmit some kind of inflationary pressure. At the same time, the demand shock which is the consequence of coronavirus has exactly the opposite consequence, so we will see exactly where we stand. It 's a very complicated story. But it 's clear that the supply shock element has an inflationary potential.
6070 6070 In the short term, no .. Because it takes a while to identify new suppliers. In the long term, probably yes.
6076 6076 India needs significantly more growth, which means significant reforms, and I think the problem in the last 15 years or so, is the reform momentum has slowed considerably,.
6079 6079 It 's been an ongoing interest of ours because we felt that it was the worst sector private equity could be involved in,.
6081 6081 We did n't have the hitting equivalent of that last year, but with the hitting coaches we 've hired-I suggest you go meet them. You 'll see what I mean,.
6083 6083 It 's the American bond holders that are calling the shots and they may have a different agenda, I do n't know how they will react.
6084 6084 That 's probably where we are going because we ca n't get them to seriously look at an income tax.
6093 6093 Every time you get a shock in the system, you get high expectations of a reaction of the central bank that 's quickly incorporated in market expectations. But there 's only so much a central bank can do.
6099 6099 We encourage students who experienced harassment or discrimination to file a bias incident report. Employees may file a complaint with the Office of Compliance. We need everyone 's support during this challenging time and to treat each other with respect and kindness.
6100 6100 A decision on when and whether in-person instruction will resume will be shared in early April,.
6103 6103 It is reported that those who died or were tortured are mostly Muslims. India is a secular country we ca n't divide Hindus and Muslims. As an Indian citizen, I ca n't help but worry,.
6109 6109 These are extraordinary and sobering times and we must respond with a deep a sense of social justice so that our very humanity is not compromised,.
6113 6113 With payroll tax financing, you get the benefit even if you quit your job,.
6120 6120 If we do n't do a good job helping small businesses survive this today, the cascading effects will be felt for years to come. They are the job providers and creators for millions of Canadians. They are the connective tissue of our communities. Small business really is too big to fail.
6124 6124 If we were to do that today, we could stop some of the additional haemorrhage.
6125 6125 It was when Judy Rich, our CEO, handed [ Goldberg ] the phone after the third or fourth iteration of the intubation box and she said, ` This is Dr. Lisa Goldberg from the emergency department' that there was a bit of silence for a moment,.
6126 6126 One of the top issues the new FM should address is the economic fallout from Covid-19, especially as the growth momentum has been decelerating,.
6127 6127 Based on the SARS 's experience, the service sector is likely to be more severely affected than the manufacturing sector, especially for the transportation sector, which is an important component of services,.
6131 6131 If anything, Democrats tend to be younger, and younger people tend to use online and social media more than older people. [ Two separate studies found ] that sharing of ` fake news' was highly concentrated in a tiny portion of the population, was largely done by conservatives, and interacted with age -- primarily driven by people over 65. In other words, the problem of online dissemination seems to be driven by older conservatives -- precisely the demographic of Fox News.
6132 6132 Our choices are influenced by what we think and feel at the moment,.
6139 6139 Modi government has been following a consistent policy while dealing with the e-com companies. Óne should not read too much into such statements, articles in Washington Post have nothing to do with government stand on e-com giants like Amazon and Walmart.
6141 6141 because in the grand scheme of things that seemed pretty small fry.
6145 6145 You need individuals who are genuinely ethical, trustworthy and professional, which probably means giving them some formal training in data ethics principles. Then you need to put in place a governance structure that holds them to account, but also gives them the autonomy to put those ethical principles into practice.
6146 6146 I think we 've shown Universa 's method of risk mitigation to be the most effective,.
6147 6147 As you know, I am a strong believer that, if a risk mitigation strategy merely slashes a portfolio 's risk at a cost of growth of capital in that portfolio ... then it was simply ineffective and probably not worth doing,.
6148 6148 If the gardens were opened today we would have been able to salvage 40 % of the first flush teas which is the largest revenue earner for Darjeeling tea industry. The chief minister has now sought time. If the gardens reopen in Wednesday then we could still salvage 15 % -20 % of the first flush crop,.
6153 6153 Closing them would damage the kids' education. They might have to go to grandparents, the more vulnerable people, so they are best at school.
6160 6160 In an ideal world, policy makers would maximize the confidence impact and efficacy of their measures by announcing all of them fast and jointly,.
6161 6161 It could be a day, could be twelve months, who knows ?.
6166 6166 It can be difficult in today 's information-rich society to know exactly where to go for knowledge about how to keep yourself and your loved ones safe. But it is critical that we remain as diligent about the accuracy of the information we share as we are about every other precaution we take to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe,.
6168 6168 The fact that several students said they feel this event would threaten their mental health, physical health and safety means we need to step up,.
6169 6169 The main message from this downside scenario is that it would put many countries into a recession, which is why we are urging measures to be taken in the affected areas as quickly as possible,.
6172 6172 I think a lot of well-intentioned people in health care ca n't handle the truth,.
6174 6174 I very much think we should all be wearing masks now because in Singapore and Taiwan where there are n't many cases they are all doing so, so they must work.
6175 6175 In conversations with other institutions with [ similar programs ], one of the main challenges found is if there is n't a faculty line linked to it.
6176 6176 When I came back to thinking about this 30 years later, Olson seemed more like a visionary.
6183 6183 I am looking forward to seeing how it could revise our views and understanding on a whole host of international financial issues. They have only scratched the surface. Many young economists could construct whole careers with this data.
6185 6185 If you 're really terrible at something, you always admire those who can do it well .... This may sound maudlin, but this city, this state, this country has given everything to our family.
6190 6190 If this becomes the same type of nightmare -- in providing things like the small-business aid and the expanded unemployment assistance -- then a lot of people are going to suffer.
6195 6195 The idea that any country can be an island in an integrated global economy is proven wrong by the latest outbreak of COVID-19,.
6197 6197 I believe that monetary policy is in a good place and should continue to support sustained growth, a strong labor market, and inflation running close to our symmetric 2 % objective,.
6199 6199 Research shows that cash profit-sharing plans, combined with a supportive corporate culture that encourages employees to offer suggestions and participate in solving company problems, can reduce turnover and improve corporate performance and personal motivation.
6201 6201 We had to rush in to stop the water, pull up the carpets and save those floorboards. Once they 're cleaned up and polished they will look beautiful. They 're in excellent condition ; they 've been covered over since the 30s or 40s,.
6203 6203 As an Emerging Market Investor, I am very aware of the critical role infrastructure development plays in unlocking a countries growth potential. At the same time, infrastructure is an investment opportunity for investors like us. The Belt & Road initiative is probably the largest global infrastructure program ever initiated and I look forward to talking to the people involved in this major enterprise at the Belt & Road Summit in Dubai.
6204 6204 The sledgehammer approach being used in most European countries and the United States is turning out into a very costly mistake. And what I mean by sledgehammer is they have n't planned anything, they just have a blanket program where we 're all locked in our condos or houses and ca n't move, and the economy shuts down,.
6205 6205 Modi has wasted his time with ethnic and religious things ; he should be rationalising the bureaucracy so it is parasitising less on society,.
6208 6208 distracts politicians from doing what they should be doing.
6211 6211 because the panic is not just about [ if ] their money [ is ] in the bank. The panic is much more about people 's health .... We 're gon na end up doing stimulus policies out of this, even in the United States, even with the civil war going on in the political sphere. They 're going to do some kind of significant fiscal stimulus this year to try to mitigate the coronavirus. Call me an optimist, but I 'm expecting that.
6216 6216 This is going to be enormous. I do n't think anyone who tells you otherwise is being fully frank,.
6218 6218 Within 10 years, these low-carbon fuels would need to account for around 15 % of overall investment in fuel supply if the world is to get on course to tackle climate change,.
6220 6220 It is very good that the OPEC + countries came to an agreement last Sunday but in my view we lost two very important months in the oil industry and we may well see prices still getting some downward pressure in the days or weeks to come,.
6221 6221 This welcome halt in emission growth is grounds for optimism that we can tackle the climate challenge this decade,.
6222 6222 Chinese decisions on coal, or in general, affect the global coal markets,.
6223 6223 The extreme volatility we are seeing in oil markets is detrimental to the global economy at a time when we can least afford it.
6228 6228 The Congress' policy is equal justice to everyone. But people have doubts about whether that policy is being implemented or not.
6229 6229 The PM and home minister are only indulging in statements and counter statements, claims and counter claims. Congress party wants that meaningful political activities should be initiated in the valley at the earliest. This political tourism of taking the ambassadors on guided tour of Jammu and Kashmir should be stopped. This is our demand in the context of Jammu and Kashmir,.

6236 6236 History has vindicated Krishna Menon on the negotiated settlement with China. In the last 16 years, we have been negotiating. The biggest tribute to him is today India and China are negotiating ... I would say the best tribute to Krishna Menon came from Vajpayee by him going to China in 2003,.
6242 6242 Our baseline outlook for the global economy is increasingly pessimistic. Still, given how quickly events are moving and the high degree of uncertainty around the virus' path, it may not be pessimistic enough. There are three critical known unknowns -- the trajectory of the virus, the policy response, and what other problems may develop due to the extraordinary pressure on the economy and financial system. Numerous and far darker economic scenarios are possible depending on how these -- and other unknown unknowns -- play out,.
6246 6246 Lower uncertainty in the UK could boost business investment,.
6248 6248 Safety means assuring police presence by having police stations inside the campus. Today we have to summon the police ; it takes time. Having a police station is important for university campuses in the country. This is not only for JNU, but we should start with JNU,.
6250 6250 The govt needs to clarify if IB officer Sharma was targeted and killed at the behest of AAP 's Tahir because Sharma was tailing him for Tahir 's Bangladesh terrorists connection. If true, it becomes a very, very serious matter.
6253 6253 Prime Minister Narendra Modi can answer the question. I am in favour ( of this ). Lord Ganesha removes obstacles. I rather say that a picture of Goddess Lakshmi ( on currency notes ) may improve the condition of Indian currency. Nobody should feel bad about this.
6257 6257 The Board will continue to monitor developments carefully, including in the labour market. It remains prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy, full employment and the achievement of the inflation target over time.
6261 6261 The Board will continue to monitor developments carefully, including in the labor market. It remains prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy.
6264 6264 In the current environment, this would be unhelpful,.

6274 6274 The ACCC was concerned that without the divestments, the proposed acquisition would substantially lessen competition in the cider market and remove a vigorous and effective competitor in the beer market,.
6276 6276 Consumers with underperforming connections are encouraged to get in touch with their RSPs, and ask whether a technician may be able to fix their connection issues,.
6277 6277 I strongly encourage everyone looking to purchase life insurance to first check the cover they may have under existing policies and through their superannuation fund.
6278 6278 If we catch these scammers misleading people, we can take them to the Federal Court. And then the penalties can be up to $ 1.1 million per breach, or up to $ 250,000 for individuals,.
6280 6280 What a get out of jail card for Josh Frydenberg. I 'd grab it with both hands if I was the treasurer,.
6282 6282 For the first episode of a new format, we did n't want to have too many people catfishing because it could be confusing to track. In my head it should be two or three people who were catfishing or embellishing who they are from the beginning, but then we have the ability to increase,.
6283 6283 I think [ globalisation ] created an opportunity, but we have to manage the social institutions to make it possible. Compared to the United States or UK, Aussies are relatively trade friendly-provided it looks after the workers and pays good wages.
6287 6287 Whether the epidemic helps deliver the good or the most evil society will depend, of course, on us -- on whether progressives manage to band together.
6290 6290 Workers in occupations that can be performed at home typically earn more. If we assume all occupations involve the same number of hours of work, the 37 percent of U.S. jobs that can plausibly be performed at home account for 46 percent of all wages,.
6294 6294 The cost of doing nothing is so astronomical, it is unbearable for the state of Maryland if we continue to perpetuate a system with deep inequities where less than 40 % of our high school graduates are reading at a 10th grade level or doing Algebra I, Algebra II math at a sufficient level,.
6295 6295 I think it 's a way to try to smear her in this campaign,.
6296 6296 The appeal of carbon markets is that, once they are established with the right rules, you can connect them to other markets,.
6299 6299 As UTM we stand a chance if we work very well. We are a good organization well represented across the country,.
6300 6300 These are extraordinary times, and we must take bold and decisive actions to save and protect millions of lives in Africa,.
6301 6301 Given the fast pace of change, driven by the 4th industrial revolution -- from artificial intelligence to robotics, machine learning, quantum computing -- Africa must invest more in re-directing and re-skilling its labor force, and especially the youth, to effectively participate,.
6304 6304 Farming might not be attractive in Sierra Leone because there is no guarantee facility for lending to farmers. We can continue to engage your government to ensure the de-risking farming, introducing new rice variety.
6305 6305 It is a historic day for us as a Bank. I think collectively we should be very proud of what has happened ... difficulties can not be allowed to exist forever .. because it defeats the very purpose of why we are here to serve,.
6317 6317 If we look at all deaths, when the unemployment rate went up by one percentage point, deaths went down by a half of a percentage point,.
6319 6319 It is impossible at this point to make a serious prediction about whether this time will be different,.
6322 6322 I think food delivery apps will become more sophisticated and will be more targeted as well,.
6323 6323 Consumers could actually deliberately steal the industry 's intellectual property,.
6326 6326 I believe that monetary policy is in a good place and should continue to support sustained growth, a strong labor market, and inflation running close to our symmetric 2 percent objective,.
6328 6328 If there is a risk to that outlook, it is skewed to the downside,.
6331 6331 The PSD wo n't be successful if it keeps putting its leader through the grinder,.
6334 6334 Clearly, when you have an event of this magnitude, it calls for finding means of which can support to make sure there is that there is life.
6344 6344 I am quite optimistic that in very difficult moments we would see the appetite for more coordinated action,.
6345 6345 Under any scenario, global growth in 2020 will drop below last year 's level. How far it will fall, and for how long, is difficult to predict, and would depend on the epidemic, but also on the timeliness and effectiveness of our actions. This is particularly challenging for countries with weaker health systems and response capacity -- calling for a global coordination mechanism to accelerate the recovery of demand and supply.
6346 6346 at least as bad as during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis or worse.
6350 6350 it would be prudent to prepare for more adverse scenarios.
6354 6354 it would be irresponsible to offer any speculations around what may happen.
6358 6358 If I had to identify a theme at the outset of the new decade,.
6359 6359 We would like very much to see them prioritising, first and foremost, urgently beefing up their health service capacity so that lives are saved and suffering is reduced.
6361 6361 Economists can not predict when and how such a point will be reached.
6362 6362 However, that should not obscure the fact that the various initiatives add up to an unprecedented and unusually fast response around major parts of the globe.
6364 6364 Everything that the Bank of Israel could have done -- we did.
6369 6369 You are my everything. I could not love you more,.
6371 6371 Women must be communal and collaborative, nurturing and giving, focused on the team and not themselves, lest they be viewed as self-absorbed,.
6372 6372 We think there needs to be more constraints on companies like ours and more standards that we can all adhere to, so we can decide together what is political speech, what is content that should be reviewed, what is privacy that individuals should have,.
6373 6373 ( Tom ), you are my everything. I could not love you more.
6378 6378 I was trying to make chit chat. He said ` Well you should n't have bare legs' or something to that effect.
6380 6380 As well as twins already registered with Twins Research Australia, we would like to invite all twins across Australia to participate in this research. Together, we can apply the power of twin research to make a difference to countless lives, both in Australia and globally.
6381 6381 We welcome any steps that can lead to the reduction of violence -- the Taliban have to show a real will and a real ability to deliver a reduction of violence on the ground,.
6383 6383 We strongly believe in dialogue with Russia. We believe in arms control. We must avoid a new arms race -- that 's dangerous, especially when it comes to nuclear weapons.
6386 6386 This dangerous situation must be de-escalated and we urge an immediate return to the 2018 ceasefire to avoid further worsening of the horrendous humanitarian situation in the region and to allow urgent humanitarian access for those trapped in Idlib.
6387 6387 NATO allies and NATO already play a role in the region and in the fight against terrorism, but we can do more,.
6389 6389 I actually think you could interpret this as the opposite. Fifteen years ago, an IPO was the indicator of success and most companies sought to do it as early as possible. [ But ] there is a growing recognition that public markets may be an inhospitable environment in which to grow a business.
6390 6390 I hate to leave football, but I know I 'm finished, and I know I can not go on this year.
6392 6392 If we do n't do this, they wo n't forgive us,.
6393 6393 So, if we set up a Distressed Banks Assets Recovery Trust, then the Ghanaians would know that the monies we are paying to them, we are going to sell the assets of these people who stole their fixed deposits to repay and deduct from the taxpayer,.
6395 6395 What is not up for debate however is our employee-ownership model or the sale of either of our two brands,.
6399 6399 On the face of it, this looks like an inconsequential, uninteresting payroll report. But nothing could be further from the truth [ ... ] the surveys are wrong ; labor demand remains strong enough to continue pushing down the unemployment rate.
6402 6402 I was asked by the police if I knew all the boys at Sharon 's funeral. About 10 minutes later my daughter came out of her bedroom and she had her mother 's sign-on book from the funeral and his name was in it.
6406 6406 They sense that the Fed is out of control. It 's almost a rogue agency in that it has become so dominant, so powerful, a force that financial markets are really paralyzed unless they know what Ben Bernanke is thinking.
6407 6407 I do n't think it 's the job of the Federal Reserve to accommodate political agendas.
6408 6408 would lower rates as fast, as efficiently, as expeditiously as possible.
6409 6409 may pay off even sooner.
6413 6413 So we can say that this is a kind of problem ( for them ), because amidst such a terrible environment, they ( girls ) may face more violence than usual .... Often, violence and oppression will be directed more frequently at them. And in several ways, their lives may be made to be unbearable.
6414 6414 As I said, unity makes protests easier, but if unity is not there, we still have to move on and do whatever is necessary,.
6415 6415 Unity makes protest easier but if unity is not there still we have to move on and do whatever is necessary,.
6416 6416 The period during which the country grew at high GDP growth rates like nine per cent, the exports-to-GDP ratio was 20 per cent. But now with developed countries resorting to protectionism and after the collapse of the WTO, the contribution of exports to GDP in a large way does not seem possible.
6419 6419 We should embrace this with enthusiasm,.
6420 6420 About half of Russians live on salaries of less than $ 500 per month. That means they can only afford the most basic staples,.
6421 6421 We worked on the address from the point of view of calculations. I participated in meetings with the president. About 450 bln rubles should be used this year,.
6423 6423 all federal executive bodies to refrain from work trips or cancel them, including travel for personal purposes.
6424 6424 Please notify your press services about the possibility of such incidents so that if you are unable to provide a quick response for some reason-if you are away on a business trip - they can turn to the government 's press service and coordinate their steps with the cabinet,.
6426 6426 but if the Republicans do n't want to be branded as public enemy number one, again, they 've got to swallow their pride, they 've got a swallow their ideology, and get with this program.

6432 6432 I could n't have asked for any more after the Frickley defeat. It 's been the perfect way to bounce back and a remarkable return for us.
6433 6433 I was not looking for this fight, but once I heard repeated credible reports from disgusted whistleblowers that Mr. Nygard was abusing young, vulnerable women, I could not ignore the disturbing information. I sought to help and empower them with appropriate law enforcement authorities.
6438 6438 I think people would give you £ 100 million not to f * * * ing make that record, you know what I mean ? They 'd just go ` yeah, look, here 's £ 100 million quid for the tour and here 's another £ 100 million quid to not make a record like that.'.

6442 6442 People taking early benefits will end up with a lifetime of lower payouts, and if they already ate into their 401 ( k ) s, they 'll be more likely to face shortfalls in their later years,.
6445 6445 Though we cut the corporate tax rate, we will widen our tax base and maximize our spending so that there is no economic shock. This must be maintained because there is a global economic slowdown,.
6446 6446 We truly regret that these sort of incidents keep repeating. It seems to have been caused by ineffective coordination among Malaysian authorities, among other things,.
6449 6449 best way to promote ZBNF will be to give it a level playing field by reforming the regime of subsidy on chemical fertilizers to direct cash transfer to farmers, and freeing up the prices of chemical fertilizers in line with what the Economic Survey 's chief architect, Krishnamurthy Subramanian, suggests.
6450 6450 So where is the need to revise or increase it ?.
6451 6451 In fact, there should be a clear plan for reforestation and restoration of agricultural land that is no longer productive. Forests are important carbon sinks and Malaysia as a megadiverse nation must have clear guidelines on sustainable practices to protect this natural resource,.
6453 6453 Please send everyone home now. With your leadership, we can end this now.
6455 6455 If you can buy Hilton at $ 60 when it was trading at almost $ 120, it 's going to be a bargain.

6461 6461 The RBA are 50 basis points from the effective lower bound. In this context, conventional central bank wisdom suggests that the policy of least regret is to move quickly once it becomes clear that there are material downside risks to the modal forecasts for growth and inflation.
6463 6463 All the indications are that it will be extremely difficult to reach an agreement within 11 months. Consequently, if it will take one or two more years to work out a free trade agreement, the UK government should abandon its plan to end the transition period at the end of 2020,.
6466 6466 It 's going to draw attention and media to the Beltline that it would n't otherwise get.
6467 6467 A big looming shock calls for an early and aggressive policy response, but such a response could turn out to be unnecessary and look panicky,.
6470 6470 Chair Powell 's statement on Friday suggests to us that global central bankers are intensely focused on the downside risks from the virus,.
6471 6471 In honor of the truth, ( López Obrador ) did not say that he would do it, but he did say that he would consider it, ( which ) is very questionable from various points of view,.
6473 6473 The bottom line is that I think the odds of a global recession because of this virus are pretty close to 100 per cent, because the decline in China is still large, because the European economy was already so weak,.
6480 6480 And with that, Mr. Chairman, I will be voting ` yes' on the new NAFTA today, and I would urge my colleagues to join me in doing so,.
6481 6481 I have been informed by multiple sources that EPA political officials appear to be trying to conceal EPA comments that are critical of the draft final [ SAFE Vehicles rule ],.
6482 6482 By contrast, the Trump administration recently weakened an EPA rule that would have better informed communities about the potential dangers of chemicals stored nearby.
6486 6486 The steps we take over the next two weeks will make the difference as to whether or not our health service is able to provide the very best care to those who need it and will also protect our hardworking and dedicated frontline health and social care staff.
6487 6487 I think we will inevitably see cases at some stage ... It should come as no surprise when we get our first case,.
6492 6492 tens of thousands of working-class people in Seattle, and hundreds of thousands across Washington state, are going to be unable to pay rent or mortgage.
6494 6494 It will not end evictions. It will delay them, and we know that delaying will provide a real lifeline and could potentially completely prevent evictions, but on the whole, this wo n't be enough. We also do need rent control, and we need major expansion of social housing. So we ca n't stop fighting.

6526 6526 I think Zimbabwe, for us, represents some of the successes of the continent and some of the expectations of the continent,.
6528 6528 We must build back better, by ensuring that we are climate conscious in rebuilding and by leveraging the digital economy.
6529 6529 So this show is really a question : what do you do ? It 's about a group of vigilantes who try and reclaim the power. If you hunt monsters, do you risk becoming a monster yourself ?.
6533 6533 When I was a young kid, hearing those stories my grandma would tell me, the only thing I could relate to were comic books and superheroes -- these stories of great good but grand evil, the horrors of which are really difficult to even try to understand. So that became the lens through which I began to see these stories, the Holocaust,.
6535 6535 There 's so much story to tell that I think the long form nature of series television allows you to really live in the nuances and depths and really explore a diverse group of stories,.
6543 6543 I do n't think it 's going to be a persistent driver of equities markets. It 's different because shale oil provides a cushion. The oil market is not as sensitive as it used to be. I think the risk premium on the oil market will be somewhat higher but it 's not like it 's totally game changing.
6544 6544 If he is lacking experience in the government sector, it could be compensated by the civil service,.
6546 6546 There will be groups that are not in the aid package, so the government must identify them and help them.

6553 6553 I think that more than anything, Putin is absolutely terrified by the assassination of Soleimani,.
6554 6554 But if we knew something, we would stop provoking. We would stop trying deliberately to destabilize.
6556 6556 Getting the for-profit element out would allow us to better prepare for pandemics like this. Like having adequate back-up facilities and inventory,.

6561 6561 The coronavirus outbreak is likely to be only one of many negative shocks that will hit the global economy this year. Others include the risk of a war between the US and Iran causing a spike in oil prices ; political chaos in the US as foreign rivals interfere in the upcoming election ; and an escalation in tension between the US and China.

6572 6572 Lots of firms in the euro area are already feeling the pinch from the spread of the coronavirus, but the smaller ones may need the most support [ ... ] To play its part, the European Central Bank will probably throw them a lifeline this week, helping to avoid the widespread bankruptcies and layoffs that could threaten price stability once the virus outbreak has passed.
6576 6576 She is much weaker today and her own CDU/CSU party is bitterly divided. Even if she tried, it would not be sustainable,.
6577 6577 A new crisis - and there always will be a new crisis-will test the eurozone severely, especially if, as is likely, Italy is the epicentre of the crisis. Political divisions will deepen as financial tensions unfold, and the crisis could tear through the eurozone 's financial safety nets.
6578 6578 The labor market is changing so fast that our official statistics -- intended to measure changes over months and years rather than days or weeks -- ca n't really keep up,.

6583 6583 What a special, uplifting, informing and empowering gathering we had for Holocaust Memorial Day in Letchworth Garden City ! Although we focused and reflected on the tragedies of the Holocaust and the subsequent modern genocides, the overall message shared and experienced was what we can do to build a society based on unity and love in our mindset and actions.
6584 6584 Women 's relative gains in turnout over time appear to be explained by generational change,.
6585 6585 And, if you 're a contract company, how do you get the contract ? By being the lowest bidder. You 're at rock bottom, offering just barely enough to attract any workers at all.
6586 6586 I fully intend to keep on top of my mental health during this challenging time and I hope I can reach as many other people as possible so they can manage theirs too.
6589 6589 But mortgage rates may increase as inflation kicks in and economic activity markedly picks up.
6590 6590 The real estate sector will hold up very well because of the rate cut. Hesitant homebuyers will be enticed to take advantage of low interest rates. Commercial property prices will rise due to higher returns than can be had from the bond market after adjusting for risks.
6593 6593 The problem of road accidents has not diminished the way we hoped. The recommendations proposed by our expert group are effective actions -- it is now a matter if it gets done or not,.
6596 6596 We can not revive the innocent victims. We can hardly ease the pain of those who lost their loved ones. The only thing we can and must do is keep the memory alive and search for the historical truth,.
6598 6598 Since we have yet to gauge how far the pandemic will affect our overall economy, preserving ammunition in the form of the policy rate might come in handy,.
6599 6599 If, later on, it strengthens too far and it affects the economy negatively, we will not hesitate to guide it towards its fundamentals, using market mechanism.
6600 6600 Even though this is the case, the Tasmanian gazette-legislation also allowed any Tasmanian to choose their shack or holiday home as their ` temporary permanent residence' for the duration of this pandemic.
6603 6603 There are now tentative signs that global growth may be stabilizing, though at subdued levels,.
6605 6605 would be even more effective if it were coordinated across all the advanced economies of the world,.
6608 6608 So small most wo n't even notice it. Those who do n't have or will lose their jobs wo n't get it at all.
6611 6611 I need you tell your business contacts how there is an ecosystem here to support their business growth, how their suppliers and distributors should be here.
6612 6612 We wanted the master servicing plan to align with the Innisfil Heights ( plans ). It also makes a better business case. The cost of the servicing could be spread out among a larger area, making it more cost effective,.
6615 6615 I think you 're going to start to see some real problems beginning to develop. The stress on the balance sheets were already there before Monday,.
6616 6616 increasing female labour-force participation to the levels of men could boost regional GDP by 47 per cent. Currently, $ 575 billion in regional income is lost because of gender-based discrimination in laws, social norms and practices that constrain women 's rights and opportunities.
6619 6619 The materialization of these risks would test the ability of policymakers to respond effectively to negative events,.
6623 6623 the poor were not blamed for their own poverty, or at any rate not to the same extent.
6626 6626 Yale does what Yale thinks is appropriate to do, and we do what we think is appropriate for Harvard,.
6629 6629 It is heart-breaking for everyone who loves Evie, but her family are looking forward to seeing how many people can join them on social media by wearing a bow or ribbon and posting photographs.
6638 6638 was the best we could do at the time given the political constraints,.
6640 6640 So that 's not necessarily for them about increasing economic growth. It 's about public health. For others, it would let them continue to pay the rent. And for still others, it would put them in a better position to spend after all of this is over.
6645 6645 Of course, viruses know no borders, race, or ideology. The World Health Organization ( WHO ) explicitly named the virus in a neutral manner precisely to avoid discriminatory association with regions, races or classes. The world must be vigilant not to let xenophobia manifest at times like this, when countries should come together to secure a victory for humanity.
6648 6648 When they ca n't speak up freely, you threaten the safety of the public and of the healthcare workers. We need to be able to rely on our physicians as well as our policy makers to make well rounded decisions. And, so, I think it 's important that physicians, whether they are self-employed or employed by someone else, are able to speak up for safety without fear of retribution.
6649 6649 you said you would n't do in the past in terms of Medicare.
6651 6651 I do n't think the worst is behind us in terms of the economic impact. The worst is yet to come,.
6655 6655 Thank you President Trump. ! I think you are well orchestrating the compulsion of history and demand of destiny that we and India be the best of friends, joined at the hip and yet as family, free hearts and minds to love across a spectrum of emotions, but always together,.
6657 6657 This may be the last year we kick the can down the road do you think ? I do n't know,.
6659 6659 For decades, health economists have been searching to find the holy grail of a natural experiment to tell us what would happen if people could n't sue for malpractice,.
6660 6660 If I walk on the street and if I have money in my account, and I 'm not thinking about my goals, I might feel rich and say ` Hey I can get these new sunglasses,'.
6663 6663 Oh Steve, could you move the Camira ? I need to get the Torana out so I can get to the Commodore.
6681 6681 I 'm bothered by the assumption that if we were n't trading as much with China, all these jobs would magically appear in the U.S. economy,.
6685 6685 acting as if it is an economic conqueror,.
6689 6689 I think somewhere in there is a good point -- when you 're playing a zone defense, it 's probably hard to judge a player 's individual defensive ability,.
6691 6691 The introduction of nuclear energy requires a number of related elements to be thoroughly analysed and further developed so that this form of energy production is competitive with other alternatives. Already in the early stages of working together to find the best solutions, we can be sure that there will be greater mutual understanding at a later stage.
6693 6693 We can all shout at him and resist his proposals, and in the end he will at least have the satisfaction of being proved right,.
6695 6695 Have people call us, if they need help,.
6697 6697 prioritise spending on the poor and reduce or delay less important expenditure.
6700 6700 We would lodge a complaint against the police stations, which forced us to call off the programme for the time being. This is completely undemocratic,.
6702 6702 If the ( bond market ) situation worsens, the Bank of Korea ( BOK ) could also review lending money to non-bank financial institutions to stabilise the corporate bond market,.
6704 6704 Indeed, in Easter, we are certain that all hope is not lost. We must therefore strive to use the period for sober reflection and prayers for the nation and humanity bearing in mind that God, in II Chronicles 7:14, assured that if we humble ourselves and pray and seek His face and turn from our evil ways, he would hear us and forgive our sins and heal our land. A time as this calls for such humility of heart and total reliance on God for solution.
6706 6706 Tell us even if you have a deal with the US,.
6708 6708 W e 'd seen how the Proper Pig had done it and we thought why do n't we jump on board,.
6709 6709 Dealers can hire someone with this certificate knowing they are hiring someone who can immediately contribute to the dealership, know their way around Mercury products and are already partway towards being certified,.
6720 6720 They get to be in an environment where they feel safe, I think for any young person that 's huge. To feel safe where they are, and do n't feel judged,.
6723 6723 If you can get 5 megabytes when you are out and about, that 's great to find restaurants, galleries, take a video and upload it to the cloud,.
6725 6725 Looking ahead, given the huge importance that the regulation of digital platforms is going to have for the global economy, the European economy and also for the preservation of democracy, it would be almost suicidal to erode the credibility of competition policy.
6726 6726 It immediately made me think of the gold people who pretend to be statues in the city as a performance, which is simultaneously an imitation of sculpture and an endurance test,.
6735 6735 We are working hard to respond to this request so that a proposal can be considered by the IMF 's executive board as soon as possible.
6742 6742 There needs to be bottom-up analysis of the impact so we can then agree on synchronised, or even better, co-ordinated measures to protect the world economy from a more serious shock,.
6744 6744 While some uncertainties-like disease - are out of our control, we should not create new uncertainties where we can avoid it.
6745 6745 I 'm very encouraged by what I see now. I see much clearer understanding [ among global leaders ] that if we do n't beat it everywhere we wo n't be able to get out of it,.
6746 6746 The COVID-19 virus-a global health emergency-has disrupted economic activity in China and could put the recovery at risk,.
6750 6750 acute stress in Italy could push global markets into uncharted territory.
6753 6753 I do think it 's likely we 'll continue to see this kind of activity,.
6754 6754 But today 's hurricane-sized increase is nothing compared to what we can expect in coming weeks.
6756 6756 I am very disappointed that these local community concerns continue unabated as no fine or sanction has been put in place to underline the importance of licencing for such forestry activities. Landowners responsible must realise that their actions impact upon our constituency alongside its heritage.
6757 6757 I think you should just give people money. They will spend more of it,.
6761 6761 ... great attention must be paid to the sources of life and to the dumps where our refuse is piled.
6764 6764 I was thinking more about how physically close he was to me than what he was saying.
6767 6767 I know it 's your job, but it ai n't safe, and my strong advice to you is to go home, those who can and are able to, take care of your families and God help us all.
6769 6769 Adelaide Tools is one of only two tool specialists with a physical presence in Adelaide, and competes strongly on price, innovation, range, and service quality. Our preliminary view is that the proposed acquisition would stifle this competition.
6773 6773 The main thing is who can beat Trump,.
6776 6776 We wonder if the key response of businesses to the intensification of the trade war in the summer was to be more aggressive in pay negotiations,.
6778 6778 Time is of the essence. Lower rates and QE should, other things equal, boost all asset price, depress the dollar, and boost money supply growth.
6784 6784 What if liquidity support is not enough ?.
6786 6786 To which extent Europeans help each other in this acute emergency can shape popular perceptions of what Europe stands for -- and for a long time to come,.
6787 6787 I would n't be one bit surprised if when we look back at the data, it is decided ... that the recession started in March,.
6789 6789 If Muslims becomes more than 30 percent that country is in danger,.
6791 6791 The public sectors are important for the development of India and these sectors need to be encouraged to prosper. The PSUs should be given freedom to take decisions and operate in sync with the market dynamics,.
6793 6793 It 's just extremely difficult to find somebody who wants to work, and seems hungry to make money doing sales,.
6794 6794 As this week 's selling has progressed, we have seen some evidence of increased caution on the part of investors. Investors are shifting away from excessive optimism but there is still little evidence of fear overwhelming complacency. Bottoms are typically processes punctuated by climactic events and seeing breadth indicators stabilize would be an encouraging sign that such a process is underway.
6796 6796 The onus for saving the economy from recession is now squarely on the Trump administration and Congress to provide a large, timely and well thought out fiscal stimulus.
6798 6798 Persistence would be measured against its impact on the outlook for inflation ... if the slowdown proved to be more persistent than what we 've built into that base case, then that downward pressure would become larger, and it 's that downside risk that we compare or measure against the other risks that we would be adding to the system by lowering interest rates and potentially fueling financial vulnerabilities.
6805 6805 We will also undertake our annual supply stocktake. This assessment is particularly relevant as evidence is increasing that the entrenched uncertainties in recent years may have weighed more heavily on supply growth than previously anticipated,.
6809 6809 The spread of COVID-19 has triggered a health and humanitarian crisis. This could potentially lead to an economic crisis and financial crisis,.
6817 6817 will be comprised of stand-alone fictional stories covering a wide range of genres and possible futures that could result from the rapid warming of our planet.
6818 6818 He is a great talent but he is their most marketable player and I would be stunned if they traded the number one guy they have that connects with the kids in their huge fan base,.
6820 6820 [ The ChiComs ] are seeking to transform it from a massive disaster to one where the government did everything right and gave the rest of the world time to prepare. There is a desire to a degree to deny realities that are staring at us in the face .... That this is a massive pandemic that originated in a place that the Chinese government really should have cleaned up after SARS.
6821 6821 If you have normal job disruption, and hiring just stops,.
6822 6822 if everybody stays home for six months.
6823 6823 alongside rising geopolitical risks and intensifying social unrest could reverse easy financing conditions, expose financial vulnerabilities, and severely disrupt growth.
6825 6825 Now, the world needs a healthy recovery, it needs a strong recovery, and that will not come about if the world de-globalises because that would severely reduce productivity in the world and that.
6826 6826 It is not economists and market experts but health experts who will be able to tell when the economy can recover,.
6829 6829 Worse growth outcomes are possible and even likely. This would follow if the pandemic and containment measures last longer, emerging and developing economies are even more severely hit or if widespread scarring effects emerge due to firm closures and extended unemployment.
6833 6833 I 've been telling this joke at parties for years, and @ GabrielSherman is the first person to think it was real. That 's what happens when the media wants to spin anything as ` Orange Man bad !'.
6835 6835 The Budget is just the Government 's scoreboard. It can put up whatever number it wants,.
6836 6836 We thought it would make sense to use the proceeds from this and not have all that food go to waste in the first place. So, it 's just a really good use of that inventory and help feed kids. What better cause is there than that ?.
6840 6840 The tightening of the monetary policy may not be liked by many people even today but from our view, for the long-term health of the economy, it was actually necessary.
6846 6846 We are now looking into what more we can do,.
6849 6849 We are not leaving Afghanistan ... NATO has said, the US has said, we are prepared to adjust our presence if the Taliban demonstrates real will and capability to reduce violence,.
6854 6854 In terms of overall readiness, the question is, how many soldiers can you cut from a brigade before it is in-operational ?.
6857 6857 With Kenya 's fiscal policy focus switching to consolidation -- involving cuts to discretionary expenditure and tighter revenue administration -- we think the CBK will be able to offset pressure on growth by providing more stimulus in the very near term,.
6860 6860 The best economic outcome that anyone can hope for is a recession deeper than that following the 2008 financial crisis.
6861 6861 I live in New York City and people there are hardly going to restaurants, cinemas or theatres, even though nobody there has been infected by the virus thus far. If it comes, we are totally f * * * ed.
6863 6863 If we hunt these monsters, do we risk becoming monsters ourselves ?.
6864 6864 without borrowing from a real person 's specific life or experience.
6866 6866 If you do n't have ample liquidity, and it 's not durable, in times of stress, as you 're looking for liquidity, you 're forced to sell assets at declining prices, which then eats into your capital position, so it becomes this very, very negative cycle,.
6869 6869 It may not be the same, but trust me, it 'll blow your knickers off,.
6870 6870 Mr Ponte was outside. On seeing police, he walked away. All of the suspects were detained by officers and identified as being part of the fight.
6879 6879 This global pandemic must bring citizens, governments and business leaders together -- and quickly. As we see a rapidly increasing number of cases of the coronavirus in Nigeria and Africa, the private sector has to work hand in hand with various Governments, in stemming the spread of the global pandemic,.
6884 6884 If you were a priest in a church, you would want to make the sinners come visit you on a Sunday.
6885 6885 Governments' first priority must be financial in nature -- specifically, they need to provide unsecured, no-interest loans and expand credit guarantee systems to ensure that companies have the funds required to stay in business and preserve jobs. Of course, governments also need to employ ordinary fiscal stimulus and monetary accommodation to prevent the economy from spiraling downwards, but there are limits to what such measures can achieve.
6886 6886 I am less worried than some people are about the short-term disruption of a no-deal outcome, simply because we 've had quite a long time to prepare for it. There really should n't be any reason for big queues at Dover or food shortages in the shops, which we might have been worried about last March.
6887 6887 If not too much damage [ is ] done to [ our ] workforce and businesses during [ this ] shutdown, we could see a fairly quick rebound. Much closer to a major snowstorm.
6888 6888 The absence of new fundamental information on the docket for Monday suggests that focus will remain firmly on the consequences of mounting tensions between the U.S. and Iran. Even if there has been a reluctance to push the rally in Treasuries overnight, equities are poised to take another leg lower,.
6889 6889 If you have a bowlful of Skittles and I told you just three would kill you, would you take a handful ? That 's our Syrian refugee problem.
6892 6892 The [ unemployment insurance ] system is already up and running : payments can flow quickly. For essential maintenance costs, the tax authority is probably best positioned,.
6896 6896 where people can give and ask help from your neighborhood.
6900 6900 Countries in East Asia and the Pacific that were already coping with international trade tensions and the repercussions of the spread of COVID-19 in China are now faced with a global shock. The good news is that the region has strengths it can tap, but countries will have to act fast and at a scale not previously imagined.
6901 6901 I would like to personally reiterate that these allegations are false and we remain committed to the highest governance standards, built on a strong foundation of ethics,.
6903 6903 there would be an upbeat mood in the market, but after a while people would realize there is still a huge amount of supply overhang,.
6907 6907 no energy company [ would ] be unaffected.
6908 6908 Saudi Arabia, which has been a stabilizer of oil markets for many years can once again play a constructive role and as chair of the G20 can bring all key economies of the world, producers and consumers together, to have a dialog to take measures to try to stabilize the oil markets.
6910 6910 According to our numbers, even this 10 million barrels cut, in the second quarter we may well see a stock building over 15 million barrels per day,.
6913 6913 My judgment is that if the Reserve Bank had not eased monetary policy last year, this adjustment by households would have been harder, the balance sheet repair would have been more difficult, and the economy would have been weaker.
6926 6926 I think Trump does actually have the right to claim a victory here, because it 's a totally unusual approach to [ rack ] up tariffs and try to break out concessions on the other side. No one has done that in decades ... it 's a victory which may unravel in the future, because the fundamental cause of the imbalances is still the fact that the American dollar is the currency for international trade and thereby by definition, the American currency is overvalued,.
6927 6927 It 's also quite likely that we will need to figure out how to reopen the economy with the virus remaining a threat.
6928 6928 No, they would n't. They 'd be in Mexico, in Vietnam, in Indonesia.
6929 6929 If the economy comes back in the third quarter, that is business delayed.
6932 6932 Precisely for that reason, there may therefore be a role for economic policy to support activity and the provision of credit in the meantime, in order to ensure that short-term disruption does n't result in longer-term damage,.
6933 6933 What I 'm saying is within the context of the framework for deciding monetary policy, we also have to look at the impact on employment and on stable prices. If other central banks engage in those unfair practices, it can impact employment, especially our manufacturers who have to compete.
6940 6940 First is that it is equally rich but we can make it more timely. Second, it is a cheaper and more effective way to produce the data.
6941 6941 I will only make a recommendation to change the way we do things if we can replicate the richness of the census data. It would have to be equally rich but more timely, cheaper and more effective. We will only change if we can do something better.
6944 6944 I am particularly curious to see what impact, if any, the Senate trial will have on the performance of Democratic candidates in the Iowa caucus. By keeping Senators ( Amy ) Klobuchar, ( Bernie ) Sanders and ( Elizabeth ) Warren off the campaign trail in Iowa, the Senate trial has the potential to disrupt the current standings.
6945 6945 I think there are quite a few people starting to predict that we might see some fairly major structural changes in the future [ linked to this crisis ],.
6949 6949 It 's pretty hard to say but the family would like to say thank you to the judge, the prosecution, and to everybody,.
6950 6950 Like many African graduates who are frustrated like me, we 're now thinking of going back to the countries that colonised us,.
6952 6952 Either the cup is half empty or half empty. To us, that is a $ 68 - $ 108 billion opportunity.
6957 6957 I expect that, certainly in China and perhaps in Asia, the first quarter numbers are going to be weaker ; there could be spillover to the U.S. economy as well in the first quarter and it remains to be seen by how much and for how long that will persist,.
6958 6958 Once you realize that people at high levels in an organization can be perfectly good board members for you, that does increase the pool of candidates,.
6959 6959 The transitional government as a whole must ensure accountability, responsibility and transparency in all decisions made,.
6962 6962 The problem is n't solved if it 's just deferred to the end of the sentence and he will know too that there 's been considerable warnings about these risks, and Ian Acheson has expressed considerable concern that the recommendations in his review have not been fully implemented.
6965 6965 In the army, they would be court-martialed, but here they would probably grant themselves bonuses because their stock options have collapsed.
6968 6968 frequent changes in the rates added to the confusion, giving the signal that rates could be adjusted through lobbying, which goes completely contrary to the signal of stability that GST should normally convey.
6971 6971 I had become bullish because of my belief that the entire country would soon go into lockdown, and that would be the fastest and best way to minimise the impact of the virus,.
6972 6972 Please send everyone home now. With your leadership, we can end this now. The rest of the world will follow your lead. A global Spring Break will save us all.
6973 6973 We believe that efforts to contain the coronavirus are likely to have a substantial negative impact on the U.S. and global economies, and on equity and credit markets.
6975 6975 It is for the first time these days that I could wear a white shirt for two consecutive days to work and not get even a speck of dust on it. Even my wife laughed saying that she did not have to scrub the collars. I really feel that we must have a 10-day lockdown in the country to breathe easy and enjoy some whiff of fresh air.
6977 6977 Many Americans have very little cash reserves or liquid assets to sustain themselves in the event of a job loss or any type of economic shock. And that becomes even more pronounced when we consider vulnerable communities,.
6978 6978 I do n't think we 've learned the lessons from 2008 at all,.
6983 6983 If you 're in a midlife crisis, just understand that lots of other people are as well,.
6986 6986 This is pretty surprising ; that it seems to be the same everywhere.
6993 6993 It creates an asymmetric situation. They can win, while you 're losing,.
6997 6997 Sometimes we would have to tell Jeann e we ca n't do that because we do n't ha ve the facilities,.
6998 6998 while it produces wealth it should also distribute wealth, thereby making it a place of justice.
7002 7002 realistically, if he does not increase his support by African-Americans, he wo n't be the nominee,.
7006 7006 If you can save a million, then save a million. The more you save the better you are,.
7007 7007 Okay. Could you actually have a recession that starts in commodity markets, through trade wars ?.
7016 7016 Men date sooner, men date more, and women get judged more. And, you know, obviously that 's super unfair. I think I 'm helping people remember that dating, for those who want to do it, is part of moving forward, and it is option B. If I could I would only date Dave. I made that choice. I made that choice. I just had that taken away from me.
7020 7020 My thoughts and concerns would be for all of the employees of his company,.
7021 7021 We 've got to get Victorians back out to these regions having their holidays and business and sport can play a leading role in encouraging that.
7023 7023 I ca n't see many firms green-lighting any projects until they can figure out what is going on.
7027 7027 Africa is at a point where if you compare 20 years ago, there are more democracies than dictatorships. And if you look at it from a conflict standpoint, there is significant reduction in conflicts, especially inter-state conflicts, although you still have insecurity and terrorism bedeviling some countries,.
7031 7031 If the spread of the virus outbreak is unable to be contained, it could turn out to be a disaster for the world economy,.
7034 7034 It worries me that they may be tame or used to humans,.
7039 7039 Suspension of duty on semi-knocked down ( SKD ) bus kits imported by approved assemblers. The kits contain parts needed to assemble buses and are typically manufactured in one country or region, then exported to another country or region for final assembly,.
7045 7045 companies may end up with debt burdens that make them unwilling to restore investment spending or re-hire workers.
7046 7046 But the truth is, ( the final budget ) will probably end up somewhere in the middle.
7049 7049 The inflation rate in the country would start receding soon which would gradually come down to comfortable level,.
7051 7051 None of this is good for psychology or the economy,.
7054 7054 Despite being classified as ` essential businesses,' many farmers markets are scrambling to modify their operations to provide a safe marketplace for vendors and shoppers, and may remain closed if physical location, financial and/or staff limitations, or supply shortages prevent them from accessing the equipment, technology, and tools they need to operate responsibly,.
7055 7055 If that cash flow dries up, instances of illiquidity can occur if clubs are unable to meet their obligations. The next step would then be insolvency.
7056 7056 If you 're getting COVID, and you have been breathing polluted air, it 's really putting gasoline on a fire,.
7061 7061 The obvious consequence of all that political discourse is that if I can trust only myself, then I should not be inclusive. I should close the country. I should protect my border, my society, the root of my country.
7062 7062 We are going to bring about 2 000 people as the UN family to Zimbabwe to showcase the good things that Zimbabwe has, but also to look at some of the challenges such as unemployment and see how as a continent we can respond to that.
7063 7063 We have a very good bankruptcy system in the United States. We have a very good set of capital markets. In most situations, they can handle it.
7066 7066 I hold no grudge against him. We should forgive each other, we should move on, we ca n't be stuck in the past,.
7068 7068 Is it hard to get senior partners or highly qualified people from the auditing profession to join ASIC ? Is it simply an income issue ?.
7070 7070 There 's an awakening that these old drugs, these old plants, magic mushrooms or ayahuasca or the Iboga root from Africa have real positive medicinal qualities,.
7072 7072 This puts the employees in a better position to take care of the clients because they 're not lying in bed at night thinking about their own job.
7073 7073 Everyone keeps trying to talk about this economic data as if we can look at it the way we look at it normally. Really, you ca n't look at it that way.
7078 7078 will lead to dirtier air at a time when our country is working around the clock to respond to a respiratory pandemic whose effects may be exacerbated by air pollution.
7079 7079 Nevertheless, monetary policymakers will want to do what they can.
7080 7080 If you look at the averages, over the last three to six months, you 're still in the 150,000 to 200,000 range, and that 's still well ahead of what you need in the long term to stabilize the unemployment rate,.
7081 7081 So we 're trying to put together all of these different sorts of tools into a toolkit that students can apply to the question at hand, which is how do you run successful campaigns ? How do you find good influencers ? How do you manage this ? How do you think about it ?.
7083 7083 No one group can do everything. But I do think that the world has a greater sense of readiness this time to develop knowledge, drugs, and therapeutics very rapidly. The scientific knowledge that will be gained from the vaccine efforts [ will ] be hugely valuable in the biomedical research field, against future outbreaks, and in the development of a vaccine to terminate this epidemic.
7085 7085 The footpath and one-way traffic laneway always worked really well. Now entry will be back where it always has been. The laneway is going to work really well for the town, I think,.
7089 7089 And guess what ? This new indicator works. Recall the days after Lehman collapsed in Sept' 08. Electricity use immediately cratered. But it took months -- and many revisions -- for the official stats like GDP or payrolls to pick up the carnage.
7092 7092 When a country is burning all across, as is happening in Delhi now ... in such situations, the minority community may get beaten. Alongside, members of the majority community, who are amongst this environment of hooliganism, may also get beaten. But in whichever families these incidents occur, in those families the worst affected are always the girls,.
7097 7097 if a local person sees it and looks at his or her state, then that person has much more information about what 's going on,.
7099 7099 It would provide a larger benefit to the well off. And it is n't targeted on those who need it.
7103 7103 European countries have faced the same kind of technological change we have, and they 're not seeing the people killing themselves with guns or drugs or alcohol. There is something unique about the way the U.S. is handling this.
7104 7104 gold was at an inflection point and could hit $ 1,800 over the next 12 months.
7106 7106 There are still gaps in the approach ; and it will mitigate, not fully remove, the hit to the economy, but he should be congratulated for what he is doing.
7107 7107 You can only use Zoom video conference calls for so long to do business. There will be normalization for the transportation sector eventually.
7110 7110 It seems like all market participants have understood the components of the ECB 's asset purchase programme,.
7113 7113 With the sanctions, we can say that the government has lost at least 30 per cent of its budget revenues. This has inevitably had an impact on their health system,.
7114 7114 Access to the Board of Trustees is something that students so desperately need because that 's the governing body that can make the structural change that most would say this university needs,.
7118 7118 People do n't mind so much if their politician lies because they think it 's for the common good.
7119 7119 But if I have this other goal, and I know I want to save for a bicycle or a summer vacation or my next car, all of the sudden the trade-off, or what 's called the opportunity cost, is much more salient and I 'm less likely to do it.
7120 7120 The wedding was amazing with indoor/outdoor spaces, and a view that you ca n't find anywhere ! You can see for miles. The brides family was able to stay in the Stable House to get ready and they had a blast being that close to the venue and yet a place to relax, watch movies and celebrate with the family.
7124 7124 While many people are sharing information about the virus and how to protect against it, only some of that information is useful or reliable. Misinformation during times of a health crisis can spread paranoia, fear, and stigmatization. It can also result in people being left unprotected or more vulnerable to the virus,.
7126 7126 If you think this would be a good idea anyways, particularly fighting inequality, then you 're not so nervous about trying to increase transfers to people to deal with that,.
7127 7127 Policy makers and altogether too many economic commentators fail to grasp how the supply component may make the next global recession unlike the last two. In contrast to recessions driven mainly by a demand shortfall, the challenge posed by a supply-side-driven downturn is that it can result in sharp declines in production and widespread bottlenecks. In that case, generalized shortages -- something that some countries have not seen since the gas lines of 1970s -- could ultimately push inflation up, not down,.
7131 7131 Even if the lockdown eases, the service jobs, like in restaurants and hotels, will be slow to increase. It could take years, not months to return to the previous levels,.
7134 7134 Europe has the capacity to do this ; but in order to be successful, the timidity and suspicion that characterised too much of policy during the euro-area crisis must be avoided this time.
7137 7137 We must constantly point to science as the solution to societal problems. Then stick to it and act accordingly !.
7143 7143 whether there could be a legislative solution to this legislative problem or whether there is a way we could tick the legal box without wasting your and a lot of other people 's time.
7146 7146 Due to the high level of uncertainties caused by COVID-19, it is yet premature to mention or consider an extraordinary session,.
7148 7148 Mr. Putin, actually, would very much like to be the MBS of Russia,.
7151 7151 Any [ parliamentary ] deputy will tell you who wants to buy this company. Do n't be surprised if their last name ends with.
7154 7154 Everything, from conceptualising to testing out how much bleach can be used safely, took us one day,.
7155 7155 If you 're tired, take a nap !.
7161 7161 That 's the nightmare they 're always thinking about.
7163 7163 You can have disruptions to financial markets, and you can have growth slowdowns ... and then this debt does become unsustainable and very difficult to service.
7168 7168 If you waved a hand and got rid of the virus tomorrow we 'd be back to normal in a week,.
7172 7172 I suspect markets may prove more volatile next week, now that there is more information and official comment than was available on Friday.
7173 7173 If we do n't start now we are locking it in for the generation to come.
7175 7175 The aspirational growth rate could be between 6.5 % to 7 %. At this stage it will be difficult to attain nine % GDP growth,.
7180 7180 This will lead to the setting up of new industries. This move can support PM 's ` Make in India' policy and help boost manufacturing, income and employment generation in the country. This also furthers Modi 's appeal to citizens to use indigenous products,.
7185 7185 We strongly advise [ students ] to reconsider non-essential personal or business travel away from Dane County,.
7187 7187 I 'm afraid of them becoming a Petri dish that could be spreading it,.
7188 7188 In practice, much would depend on how far the UK is willing to align with EU regulation post-Brexit. I think the case for this is strong, for example in relation to financial services,.
7189 7189 You will hear the [ then - ] president of the Eurogroup [ Jeroen Dijsselbloem ] and other ministers warn me that if I dare table written proposals within the Eurogroup meetings, that would be the end of the negotiations,.
7191 7191 is absolutely appalling that the U.S. took a decision to stop people coming in without any warning or any discussion with the Europeans. I think that it is without precedent and it is an illustration of the drama where we are.
7192 7192 the benefit of a cut would be very modest.
7193 7193 We have already contacted numerous businesses including gyms, travel companies, and event payment processors, just to name a few, to change their approach in relation to refunds or fees to postpone or delay a service, without fanfare but with great success in getting better outcomes for consumers,.
7194 7194 The message is still shop around, but it 's hard not to be outraged by people who are trying to keep petrol prices at $ 1.50, $ 1.60, when it should be around $ 1.10,.
7195 7195 determine if the recent falls in international crude oil and refined petrol prices were flowing through to consumers.
7197 7197 We 're basically seeing the pandemic like a war in the sense that we do need increased supply of things and basically most of the behaviour we 're allowing competitors to engage in is maintaining or increasing supply of goods or services on the one hand and hardship policies for those who ca n't pay for services like communications or electricity on the other.
7198 7198 If the ACCC won 100 per cent of the cases we took it would be a sign we were n't doing our job properly ; by only picking ` safe' cases and not standing up for what we believe in,.
7200 7200 if issues causing poor performance on some FTTN connections, such as problems with in-house wiring, had been addressed.
7201 7201 The story we 're getting is that 's due to flow on from the drought and the bushfires, and also the continual de-stocking when it comes to products such as meat. So that all seems logical.
7209 7209 As always with Liam Gallagher, we can guarantee it 's going to be an incredible night full of surprises.
7213 7213 Whether or not we like it, I think it is shaking up the conception of ` Is housing a human right ? Is shelter a necessity ? Should everyone be guaranteed a home and a roof over their head ?.
7217 7217 On January 13, we held a powerful launch rally of our Tax Amazon 2020 campaign, with 500 people rocking Washington Hall to Tax Amazon and big business to build social housing. Now join my council office and a coalition of progressive labor and renters' rights organizations -- alongside hundreds of working people in Seattle -- at the first of our grassroots democratic Tax Amazon conferences. Let 's come together as a movement to discuss different proposals for an Amazon Tax, including how much it should raise annually, what it should fund and what tax mechanism we should use, as well as to organize the grassroots strategy needed to win.
7220 7220 I was in a restaurant yesterday, possibly for the last time for a while. I was in a taxi, possibly the last time for a while. There are entire industries I interact with where I 'm realizing : ` This may be the last time I 'm paying you for a while,.
7221 7221 That it said things like, ` If there 's still a problem, more checks would go out.'.
7222 7222 Congress should pass a simple one-time payment of $ 1,000 to every adult who is a U.S. citizen or a taxpaying U.S. resident, and $ 500 to every child who meets the same criteria.
7223 7223 I think [ its about ] making your optimism and your predictions more about the long run and acknowledging it can get worse before it gets better,.
7224 7224 A one-year payroll tax cut of 2 % of income would provide up to a $ 5,508 tax cut to a high-income couple, only $ 500 to a single parent getting by on $ 25,000 a year, and nothing for a worker placed on leave without pay,.
7225 7225 If we do n't bring students back, it 's going to be a much more painful recovery,.
7229 7229 In the worst case scenario, central banks may have to confront a situation where they are called upon by their local constituencies to intervene as climate rescuers of last resort,.
7230 7230 A key question informing the BIS Innovation Hub 's work is whether money itself needs to be reinvented for a changing environment, or whether the emphasis should be on improving the way it is provided and used,.
7232 7232 My push for Terry is simply that if there 's an opportunity to give this selfless human being another honour there should be a way to do so,.
7234 7234 noticeable impact on Chinese growth ... and could spill over to the rest of the global economy,.
7235 7235 still too soon to even speculate about either the size or the persistence.
7237 7237 As long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with this outlook, the current stance of monetary policy will likely remain appropriate. Of course, if developments emerge that, in the future, trigger a material reassessment of our outlook, we will respond accordingly.
7245 7245 Assuming this rationalization occurs over the next year ( which was one of our top themes for 2020 even before this ), the industry is likely to emerge in a much more healthy position with many of the zombie companies that were a dead weight on returns removed, even paving the way for an attractive international offering of Saudi Aramco,.
7247 7247 While both policies would help support the US shale sector in the short run, this would come at the expense of higher gasoline prices to consumers, a reversal of the administration 's view that current low oil prices were equivalent to a tax cut in the face of an already sharp rise in unemployment,.
7250 7250 Sure, the global pandemic risks were there for all to see ... but no one can ever really see what 's next, what lies around the corner,.
7252 7252 I do n't think tonight is a time for regret,.
7256 7256 Those who are hit the hardest should not go bankrupt and lose their livelihood through no fault of their own,.
7263 7263 These are the times for which the IMF was created -- we are here to deploy the strength of the global community, so we can help shield the most vulnerable people and revitalize the economy,.
7264 7264 Just in the very first weeks of the new year we have witnessed increased geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and we have seen the dramatic impact that climate shocks could have. We saw them in Australia as well as parts of Africa,.
7270 7270 Some advance economies have them [ SDRs ] and do n't really need them. Some emerging-market economies could make good use of them,.
7276 7276 Now we 're saying 3.3 percent is our forecast, but there may be a cut. We 're hoping it will be in.01 to.02 percentage space,.
7278 7278 A modern version of this approach -- one that permits the issuance of virtual currencies in tandem with government ‐ issued currencies, adapting legal tender laws to permit healthy currency competition -- should be put forward,.
7281 7281 I think the intellectual diversity would strengthen the discussion,.
7283 7283 I do n't think anyone would think we can do everything ourselves in Australia. We 've been trading since the Aboriginals traded sea cucumber with the Indonesians. I do think there will be a push to put the green back in the green and gold -- to keep things fresh and clean.
7290 7290 I am certain that you have your own proposals on what legislative initiatives and what measures we should take to help our agricultural workers.
7291 7291 Over the course of two hours, we discussed and developed plans for the forum and picked a date : June 17, 1990. Now I can hardly believe that it was possible,.
7292 7292 If South African inflation were to moderate further, we would have more space to lower interest rates,.
7294 7294 It was Olivier Blanchard, a Professor of Economics, who introduced us to each other-Howitt recalls - and suggested we might want to collaborate, as we had some ideas in common. He was quite right, I think, because we hit it off immediately and began to work on theories of economic growth. And we have been doing so ever since.
7298 7298 the asymptomatic infection rate could be as much as 50X higher than expected.
7299 7299 The profit, if confirmed, would rank as one of the most profitable trades ever disclosed by a hedge fund.
7301 7301 I think it 's a good deal and I 'm hopeful that it will pass,.
7304 7304 The 50 +1 rule, in its current form, will probably no longer exist, but it is still an essential part of German football culture,.
7305 7305 Infrastructure investment is actually the best housing policy. There 's very little we can do to increase the supply of well-located land but there 's one thing you can do-build great transport.
7307 7307 If the unemployment rate were to be moving materially higher and there was no further progress being made towards the inflation target, the balance of arguments would tilt towards a further easing of monetary policy,.
7308 7308 The possibility of stranded assets and if assets are n't stranded then some are going to be worth less. And, importantly, other assets are going to be worth more.
7314 7314 If it is disrupted anywhere, the entire supply chain is held ransom and companies are going to start rethinking that should we actually have these really spread out global supply chain or to bring them back closer home and how much diversification should we have. Should we have multiple production sites across the world rather than have it focussed primarily in Asia,.
7316 7316 What is important for Ghana is how to create an instrument that enables the average or retail person as a Ghanaian, or Caribbean or African American to participate in a way that does n't conflict with securities rules,.
7319 7319 it could get really ugly for Democrats in the next few months,.
7323 7323 There 's so much Al intuits about characters, from the decisions they make, to the clothes they wear, a look, a glance, the music they love. I would watch him build this character in his mind, brick by brick, memory by memory, just sitting there. It was magical.
7326 7326 If you hunt monsters, do you risk becoming a monster yourself ?.
7330 7330 For me, if the indications of a revival abroad remain, and developments abroad tend towards optimistic, then I could imagine myself leaning again towards raising interest rates,.
7336 7336 All modernisation plans must take full account of environmental issues or we will be doing a significant disservice to future generations.
7337 7337 But I think perhaps it may be that they have to keep the tests for people who are much more vulnerable. You do n't want to take a test off someone else who is more critical than yourself.
7339 7339 promoting the study and progress of the social, economic, political and juridical sciences, offering the Church the elements which she can use in the study and development of her social doctrine.
7342 7342 The numbers given by the World Bank and IMF in terms of the changes are way too optimistic because even if we lose one month 's output, we are talking about pretty negative rate of growth and that is what should determine how we respond,.
7344 7344 Even Arvind Panagariya could not stay longer,.
7356 7356 We can only deliver our side of the deal if Taliban deliver their side of the deal.
7358 7358 I will not go into the details of that briefing. I will leave that to the United States. But we value and appreciate the briefings provided by the United States. I think this provides, or once again shows that NATO is a platform where European Allies, North American Allies, are able to come together and address security concerns for all of us.
7361 7361 Eight new destinations will be joining our network this year in addition to the recently announced gateways of Santorini, Greece ; Dubrovnik, Croatia ; and Osaka, Japan. With these new routes, our operations will expand to 177 destinations around the world, reinforcing our position as one of the world 's most connected airlines. This ensures we can continue to provide our passengers more options and flexibility when planning their business and leisure travel.
7364 7364 Under this Act, whether citizenship will be given or not will be decided after ascertaining the religion of a person. This definitely is not in tune with the constitution. Such an Act should not have been passed in the first place,.
7366 7366 Sen ... rejected the narrow argument of measuring growth only by means of GDP, and broadened the development measurement from promoting economic growth to ` expanding people 's capabilities'. He argued that the ultimate goal of development should focus on the individual 's freedom of choices, i.e. to improve the ` capabilities' of individuals to choose to live lives that they have reason to value.
7368 7368 supporters who have paid in advance for general admission tickets or matchday VIP packages for the games that could be impacted this season.
7370 7370 They need to breathe into a brown paper bag a bit, think it through clearly. This is no time to abandon the free market with government interference.
7371 7371 Inclusion is very important to me -- it 's not just like this word I like to throw around. I genuinely believe all people should be valued -- all people should feel included.
7378 7378 came from human problems, monetary and financial shocks. This is has some of the same feel, some of the feel of panic, some of the feel of volatility that you 're talking about. It 's much closer to a major snowstorm or a natural disaster than a classic 1930 ′ s-style depression.
7380 7380 we do not expect significant spillovers to the rest of the economy or to the financial system.
7384 7384 It 's really for the people of Brazil to decide if they value the rainforests or not.
7391 7391 If you ca n't use their services now, you can pay now, give them the cash and do it later.
7393 7393 a Chinese company, if people are concerned about data I think there 's a lot to be concerned about there.
7399 7399 We should probably hook up with some economic modelers and try to factor that in,.
7400 7400 It does n't take much data to swing it one way or the other and the next few [ MPC ] meetings are absolutely live,.
7402 7402 One month could wipe out 10 years of progress,.
7403 7403 Exxon was most valuable company in the world, not Amazon or Apple or Microsoft.
7404 7404 I do n't think [ the Fed ] would have done this unless they felt the financial markets were at significant risk of freezing up tomorrow. They 're very concerned the financial markets wo n't work. So I do n't know how the markets take solace in this,.
7406 7406 If you need that retirement money, then cash might not be such a bad idea for a while,.
7409 7409 This revision is well-anticipated so likely wo n't impact financial markets, but it may change perceptions regarding the strength of the labour market.
7421 7421 If these factors are sustained in 2020, we will see a notable pick up in home sales in 2020.
7422 7422 Housing, just like most other industries, suffered from the coronavirus crisis, but once this predicament is behind us and the habit of social distancing is respected, I 'm encouraged there will be continued home transactions though, with more virtual tours, electronic signatures, and external home appraisals. Many of the home sales that are likely to be missed during the first part of 2020 may simply be pushed into late summer and autumn parts of the year,.
7425 7425 If that happens youâ € ™ re looking at one of the biggest negative jobs numbers that weâ € ™ ve ever seen,.
7426 7426 And so the question is just like, if we do n't make any progress on the virus, then they 're going to have to figure something out to get people back to work.
7428 7428 the only candidate who can defeat Trump.
7429 7429 The period during which the country grew at high GDP growth rates like nine per cent, the exports-to-GDP ratio was20 per cent. But now with developed countries resorting to protectionism and after the collapse of the WTO, contribution of exports to GDP in a large way does not seem possible.
7433 7433 We are helping unlock constraints faced by women. There 's still much to do and everyone can play a role.
7436 7436 We are working to strengthen ( the ) developing nations' ability to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic and shorten the time to economic and social recovery. The poorest and most vulnerable countries will likely be hit the hardest, and our teams around the world remain focused on country-level and regional solutions to address the ongoing crisis,.
7442 7442 The voice of the youth is unlikely to be silenced easily. In any society, students and the youth are the ones most likely to speak truth to power if only because they have the least to lose and the most to gain,.
7446 7446 Research to date has focused on blunt force head trauma and/or blast exposure resulting in concussion : i.e., loss of consciousness less than twenty minutes or alterations of consciousness such as ` seeing stars' or having one 's ` bell rung,.
7449 7449 Who was behind this violence, we all know very well. I make a direct charge that HRD Minister and the Home Minister are responsible for the incident. This is nothing but an officially sponsored ` goondaism'. 72 hours have passed and Delhi Police knows who should be arrested but no arrest has been made so far in this regard. This is negligence, but a deliberate negligence,.
7451 7451 As somebody who has been associated with the power sector for almost three decades including as minister, the call to go dark for 9 min at 9 pm on the 5th can have deep impact on the grid and its stability. I sincerely hope this is being properly managed,.
7452 7452 In the last five months, no meaningful political activity has taken place in Jammu and Kashmir. Political tourism of taking envoys to Jammu and Kashmir should stop,.
7455 7455 If the outbreak could be contained in the very near future, the impact would not be severe. But what if it were to prolong ?.
7457 7457 If they do, I will go to court. They know that too,.
7459 7459 You want a growth rate of 10 percent, so the investment rate to GDP should be 37 percent and 3.7 percent should be your efficiency factor and not five percent as it is today,.
7461 7461 we 're probably going to have a second quarter growth rate that is double-digit negative.
7464 7464 Within 10 years, these low-carbon fuels would need to account for around 15 per cent of overall investment in fuel supply if the world is to get on course to tackle climate change,.
7466 7466 Given the current projections, it is already clear that the ceremony and activities must be postponed. It saddens me that our community will not be together for this important milestone this spring,.
7473 7473 We can also now brag that it delivers the worst health of any rich country.
7474 7474 Economists long thought that the ratio of wages to profits was an immutable constant, about two to one,.
7476 7476 I guess you could say I believe in taking blessings when they are offered,.
7477 7477 they are the basis for the rituals, customs and routines of working-class life. Destroy work and, in the end, working-class life can not survive.
7482 7482 The idea is to have no layoffs or company closures, so that when the coronavirus is finally under control the economy can start right back up.
7485 7485 Full-time working from home is very isolating, so we could potentially see a rise of mental-health issues around depression if large number of employees are forced to work from home for extended periods, particularly single and younger employees,.
7486 7486 the long run impact would be large -- typically motivation, creativity and new ideas come from group involvement.
7490 7490 Japanese Government supports the people of Pakistan in these trying times and is ready to offer its expertise and any sort of assistance to the government of Pakistan, if the situation so requires,.

7500 7500 If indeed we find that there are no more cases in Madison, that there 's little evidence of spread in this area, the likelihood that at that we would reopen the university to normal operations is quite high. We 'll simply have to see where we are.
7503 7503 China represents an incredible supply point for almost every imaginable product. If this is broken, a lot of companies are going to be in trouble,.
7504 7504 The doctors made detailed treatment plan, and told us all the possible scenarios that could happen. With the efforts of the Chinese doctors, my daughter made it. Now, she is just as healthy as other children. Chinese doctors are really amazing,.
7507 7507 Griffiths could have caused real harm to Sam Woods when he stamped on him. Morelos would got a red card for the same thing.
7509 7509 During the last recession, CFOs could genuinely say that their lack of planning was a result of a sharp downturn that was a surprise to most,.
7510 7510 There is nothing else left to do on the monetary side. No one should expect that the monetary stimulus will fix things,.
7511 7511 This crisis is more likely to accelerate decoupling than to lead to better cooperation,.
7512 7512 This problem is likely to grow if more people become ill. So, while we might have the food supply available, will we have the workers to get it to us ?.
7513 7513 is more fragile than we think it is,.
7516 7516 We spend a lot on marketing. There 's probably some money that can be cut out of marketing,.
7517 7517 A stroke can also be treated with a special procedure that extracts the clots or places a stent to support the vessel wall. Optimal treatment also includes control of risk factors like blood pressure and cholesterol.
7518 7518 If your money was deposited in something and you saw it losing, for sure, all the time, it would just be painful,.
7521 7521 It 's phenomenally important for people to return to social life after ` social distancing' ends, but we can do that based on new priorities -- socialising and enjoying arts and music locally or through livestreams, and letting go of 20th century visions of the future based on unlimited growth, unlimited travel, and unlimited consumption.
7523 7523 This requires a rethink of what governments are for : rather than simply fixing market failures when they arise, they should move towards actively shaping and creating markets that deliver sustainable and inclusive growth. They should also ensure that partnerships with business involving government funds are driven by public interest, not profit.
7528 7528 There is no indication that there was any damage to the park.
7531 7531 In dozens of examples, banks asked if Saba would make a price so the banks could act as agent instead of principal,.
7533 7533 psilocybin-assisted therapy appears to both work rapidly and have a sustained benefit for years. If other studies support that, the implication is potentially huge for cancer patients.
7535 7535 Likewise, I bet there are a lot of Australians who probably do n't remember what happened in every NBA game or Major League Baseball game last year.
7536 7536 The amount of employment in the economy is going through the floor. And the deficit in that context ... it 's almost a non sequitur. That 's not the sort of thing you should worry about,.
7542 7542 The imports may be good news for Baltimore in the short term, and we should be happy about that. But it wo n't make a difference for the industry long term. What 's here to stay is climate change. Both business and government need to come up with solutions because this will get worse and worse.
7543 7543 Capacity is a real problem. Can they deliver ? There was drought in Mexico. Can they supply enough ? There are a lot of moving parts, and overall it 's not a great situation.
7547 7547 And the phone caller tune message is ridiculously insufficient. We should be spreading information in every possible language through a variety of mediums.
7549 7549 For example, workers may want not be willing to sacrifice already low wages for higher health care prices that do n't reflect better health care.
7550 7550 I thought he was going to bite my finger off,.
7551 7551 The architect will charge you up to 20 percent of the construction costs if it 's just a cookie-cutter. If it 's going to be more trips to the city to fight exceptions and the city 's rules, they are going to charge more,.
7553 7553 That is a difference between us and AT & T or Verizon of around $ 120 billion and we have just as many customers and twice as much spectrum.
7555 7555 We need to tackle the emergency but we need to think about livelihoods and the long-term.
7558 7558 If you are trying to get to 3 % in an economy in its 11th year of recovery that 's a tough task,.
7559 7559 Even if you had unlimited time, if the two sides hold on to their current positions, the choice is really between a pretty limited deal and no deal at all.
7561 7561 In the near-term, we expect subscriber growth to come primarily from outside the U.S., with the next meaningful phase of domestic subscriber growth likely to coincide with the release later this calendar year of highly anticipated original content, including episodic series from Marvel and season two of ` The Mandalorian,.
7562 7562 As such, the outbreak should not directly affect the longer-term viability and productive potential of most businesses or of the as a whole.
7563 7563 If Britain is to become the global player Boris Johnson wants it to be, then it has to engage more strategically in the Asia-Pacific,.
7566 7566 Nigeria is the largest shareholder of AfDB. There is still much to do, there are still lots of challenges as we all know. I know I can not do much unless I get a second term as president of the AfDB. I want to say that once again Nigeria has given me air in my lungs,.
7574 7574 In dealing with coronavirus, the minister of health is involved. Would the minister of health be involved with Wet 's uwet' en ? Probably not,.
7578 7578 The initial improvement was mostly policy-driven, but the greater optimism of the past week seems to be at least partly related to the virus itself.
7579 7579 these shutdowns and rising public anxiety about the virus are likely to lead to a sharp deterioration in economic activity in the rest of March and throughout April,.
7582 7582 If it is like ordinary flu, then ( the ) economy should quickly recover. COVID-19 only threatens old and feeble economic expansions,.
7583 7583 To wish that the number of foreign job aspirants should be decreased on the one hand and expect remittances to increase is not logical. So our efforts should be to bring the remittances sent by the people on foreign employment through banking channel. We still need to keep the economy dynamic and functional even when the remittance is declining.
7587 7587 You can carry out and order ahead of time, but if you dine in and you have little ones, they can come to our youth center on the other side of the building.
7588 7588 Banks' concern about liability could cause them to restrict the loans they initiate and engage in due diligence that could slow down payments,.
7589 7589 Even under current conditions, I think we can afford to increase federal spending or cut taxes to stimulate the economy if there 's a downturn,.
7590 7590 Bill ! Bill ! There 's 25 police officers here raiding the office. What should I do ?.
7592 7592 I wo n't be running [ for council ] again so it 's only for six months, but I 'll certainly try to balance and give due difference to both roles, and if I find it too difficult to do that, then I 'll have to review my decision,.
7593 7593 If the crisis is badly managed and it 's viewed as having been insufficient to help people, you could end up with social unrest,.
7594 7594 It is very likely that this year the global economy will experience its worst recession since the Great Depression, surpassing that seen during the financial crisis a decade ago. The Great Lockdown, as one might call it, is projected to shrink global growth dramatically.
7595 7595 To support needed spending in developing countries, bilateral creditors and international financial institutions should provide concessional financing, grants, and debt relief,.
7596 7596 In a way, monetary policy might be the right way to go at that, for example, loan programs for specific sectors of the economy.
7599 7599 They [ central banks -- Ed. ] can kind of restrain people from having access to their capital but that 's all the kind of techniques that we saw before the bitcoin.
7600 7600 Suppose you had huge fees on your bank account because of a very negative interest rate. At some point it becomes worth it to build a vault in your basement and just keep your money there -- or more practically, divert funds to other forms of intermediation,.
7604 7604 you make sure your wishes would be carried out as you would have wanted, instead of being determined by standard rules that may not be aligned with what you would have wanted.
7606 7606 You only trade a veteran when you know you have somebody who can take that guy 's place,.
7612 7612 So the new IR35 framework from April was always set to roll out despite such severe issues of implementation. It would be more sensible to wait until 2021 ; for HMRC 's sake too.
7613 7613 My advice to other disabled people would be to concentrate on things your disability does n't prevent you from doing well and do n't regret the things it does interfere with. Do n't be disabled in spirit as well as physically.
7618 7618 Other people near you can inhale them. They can get them on their hands. They can land on their tray tables.
7621 7621 We need to make inroads. I think we need to ( take up ) constructive measures, find ways of taking this up in the community as well as in the larger Christian community,.
7627 7627 If the recent pace continues through the end of the week, California alone could report 400,000 claims for the week, and the national total would be on course for 3 million,.
7628 7628 This is just a malicious attempt to get someone killed, so that @ RandPaul can combine his hatred of the intelligence community with a nice opportunity to suck up to Donald Trump,.
7633 7633 Their job will be made much harder by trying to put together various sources that may be a little bit less reliable in one particular quarter or come in later than they normally do because of disruptions,.
7637 7637 If we start to take measures such as that, which will have a huge social and economic impact which the evidence is that they are going to have limited benefit, then really we should not be making those interventions.
7638 7638 Since the ruling party is the only authority to make these appointments, can this party say, ` I thought they were honest,' when placing this terrorist organization 's members into the state ?.
7641 7641 so that there may be a higher base of firearms owners in the years to come.
7646 7646 High fee of an MF does not matter if its past performance has been good.
7647 7647 Over the weekend, I learned of a cafe in San Francisco that requires you to download an app to access the ` restroom'. Appropriately enough, the app is called Good2Go. Meanwhile, in Chengdu ( China ), you need the ubiquitous WeChat app to acquire a ration of toilet paper. Perhaps they should rename it to WeeChat ?.
7648 7648 Several have done so without following the standard, responsible practice of first speaking with Edelweiss. Had they done so, you would have been presented with both sides of the story, equally and fairly. We are, therefore, compelled to take appropriate legal action against the concerned media group, in order to protect and reinforce the reputation of Edelweiss.
7653 7653 ought to be made a Government-wide requirement for all the administration.
7654 7654 The real question is whether a change in interest rates from negative to zero has an impact on inflation and economic growth.
7659 7659 It 's not that those other entities are n't in place, but I think the fact is banks tend to get more nervous about deposit competition when rates are going up,.
7662 7662 Some are calling for a full shutdown of the-but imagine the panic if no one could sell assets. There would truly be a run on the banks. Now is not a time to panic.
7663 7663 An entertainer can provide value to millions of people,.
7669 7669 if the on-peak to off-peak ratio is 2 to 1, but the California TOU rates have an anemic ratio of less than 1.5 to 1,.
7671 7671 the future impact of a predictable halving should already be reflected in today 's price. But the market is not actually very efficient.
7679 7679 We 've been talking to regulators about whether external appraisals will be sufficient,.
7680 7680 It is too early to assess the likely impact as to whether lower interest rates can overcome the economic and health anxieties.
7689 7689 The economy was already fragile before the outbreak and vulnerable to anything that did not stick to script. COVID-19 is way off script. COVID-19 came out of nowhere. It may be what economists call a black swan -- a rare and inherently unforeseeable event with severe consequences.
7691 7691 Our baseline outlook also depends on credit markets functioning reasonably well, albeit with significant support from the Federal Reserve. Liquidity in credit markets has become increasingly impaired, including the repo and commercial paper markets. If liquidity dries up, and short-term funding markets effectively close to large corporates that issue short-term debt and financial institutions that raise funds necessary for their own lending, the impact on the economy will be severe and immediate,.
7693 7693 How long it takes for businesses to feel confident enough to allow their employees to get back to work and travel and for tourists to get back on planes and cruise ships ... whether the collective psyche holds together,.
7694 7694 If you subtract from the weather effects, it 's probably closer to 150,000, which I consider close to the underlying rate of job growth in the economy right now,.
7700 7700 Among them must have been the published correspondence of Nehru and Patel which documents how Nehru wanted Patel as the ` strongest pillar' of his first Cabinet. Do consult those books again.
7705 7705 priority should be afforded to targeted fiscal support to vulnerable households and businesses to accelerate and strengthen the recovery in 2021.
7708 7708 There are scenarios where much more resources may be required.
7709 7709 There remains an enormous amount of uncertainty about what will happen with the coronavirus and whether it will be contained,.
7711 7711 The reason that we 're going in this direction is because we think it 's doable ... and it can be done quickly by the official bilateral creditors,.
7712 7712 When women can move more freely, work outside the home and manage assets, they are more likely to join the workforce and help strengthen their country 's economies.
7719 7719 We can not point to a definitive intervention comparable to the removal of the handle on the Broad Street Pump in St. James 's parish,.
7721 7721 As to the case of Manhattan, I think the evidence is remarkably clear,.
7725 7725 There are three things we tell the countries. First-if you have cash, if you can reduce interest rates, please do so. Second, if you have fiscal space, please use it. And third, the most important-everyone can do it-structural reforms. We see that governments around the world are actually listening.
7726 7726 And they are telling us it may get even worse, if the virus continues rounds for longer or if vaccines or treatments are slow to come around. Exceptional times requires exceptional action.
7729 7729 We have reassessed the prospects for growth for 2020 and 2021. It is now clear that we have entered a recession as bad or worse than in 2009. We do project recovery in 2021,.
7732 7732 at least as bad as during the global financial crisis or worse.
7740 7740 These advertisements should never have been approved.
7744 7744 first had to check if the plane was ready and able to make such a lengthy journey on such short notice.
7748 7748 the situation can change if an election changes it.
7749 7749 There is certain evidence that I would have liked to have seen led in this trial, but for a variety of reasons we were not able to do so. At some point that information, that facts and that evidence will see the light of day.
7751 7751 It would also have a further effect on the exchange rate, which would boost demand for our exports and therefore support jobs growth.
7752 7752 it 's entirely possible that one of the banks, insurers or super funds has been compromised and we simply do n't know about it.
7753 7753 Our appetite, as you could probably tell from my remarks, for a zero cash rate and hence, negative interest rates on central bank reserves, is very, very limited and I do n't think we 're going to go there,.
7758 7758 I think this is bottom line political calculus,.
7760 7760 We could argue or dispute what the specific number is -- and might be one in 10 in some societies, versus one in five and others.
7765 7765 Governing council will be watching closely to see if the recent slowdown in growth is more persistent than forecast,.
7774 7774 would need to be very carefully designed if it were to be introduced.
7775 7775 It 's early days but there are several initiatives -- the budget will be telling -- that suggest that some of these opportunities are being grasped,.
7777 7777 With the relatively limited space to cut Bank rate, if evidence builds that the weakness in activity could persist, risk management considerations would favour a relatively prompt response,.
7779 7779 We 've also asked the FCA to look at this behaviour of market participants relative to their responsibilities under both the FX code and the Money Markets code, so ... do you have advantaged information, are you knowingly using advantaged information, if I can put it that way.
7783 7783 If you lease it in California, you 'd pay a 9 % sales tax just on the monthly payments,.
7793 7793 will consider what more NATO can do in the wider region to build long-term stability and security.
7795 7795 Sidewalk is continuing their discussion with ( project partner ) Waterfront Toronto and if it makes sense, we are very much still focused on Google 's Canadian headquarters being there, so both can happen.
7803 7803 A storm track moving a couple of kilometers one direction or the other allows the amount of wetland protection to vary within the same county.
7806 7806 Just 60 days ago, the Trump administration proposed a rule that would fundamentally change the NEPA regulations for the first time in its history.
7808 7808 Rather than encouraging reliance on the ` best available' data and science, this proposal would result in the suppression of scientific research and the censorship of scientists and experts,.
7811 7811 Thanks to Democrats, it 's no longer the case that if one NAFTA country fails to ratify an environmental agreement it can be used to prevent the others from honoring their obligations,.
7812 7812 That would be the kind of thing that would draw serious outcry and backlash against anyone who is n't prepared to come forward with a program and an agenda to deal with a problem on a scale that is necessary.
7814 7814 This will have long-term effects on growth even if the outbreak proves short-lived.
7815 7815 The length and depth of the global economic contraction depends most importantly on whether health officials can materially slow the spread of the virus via a ramp-up in testing, restrictions on mass gatherings, and quarantines of infected people as well as their contacts,.
7816 7816 We vow to return to prudent monetary management if the market is ready to fully absorb the debt papers.
7817 7817 Recovery is likely to take place in the next six months after bottoming out in February and March,.
7818 7818 Even if they have COVID-19, but are asymptomatic or have minor symptoms, such as a cough but no fever, are under 60, have no comorbidities ( underlying health conditions ), they can just self-isolate and stay at home.
7822 7822 The launch of this new channel provides us with a substantial platform from which we can communicate with the business community and industry partners. We understand the significant importance of developing collaborative working partnerships, it is a fundamental principle of our strategy and cohesive approach of engaging with the Welsh business network.
7823 7823 So, if you net those costs out, debt will be around 58 percent or so of GDP. But the key to all of this is merely the export boost that we are expecting. And this will be an outright boost if you look at our non-oil contribution, that is about 5.4 % growth, compared to the oil growth,.
7827 7827 The report will probably consider the potential for new tools as well. Coeure raised the possibility of the central bank offering accounts to private individuals. We expect some assessment of digital currencies to be within the scope of the review. As Lagarde said recently, society is facing ` massive technological change.' Central banks are too.
7828 7828 I 've now lost a life [ but ] can we save a life by getting some lights and maybe laybys ? Let 's push to have some lights put on the junctions. Nothing can bring him back but maybe we can save a life by doing something and pushing for lights.
7829 7829 When both direct tax and GST rates get stabilised in future, a day might come when there would be no need to present budgets in the Parliament.
7831 7831 But given our past recent experience with these sorts of things, I do n't think it should ; it has n't changed my outlook or my expectation about our rates path.
7832 7832 If this [ virus ] becomes a world issue, with ripples through many countries and many economies, then that 's a different type of event than as I understand it to be today,.
7833 7833 crazy. This is a transitional government for the third time and it can do whatever it likes [ without oversight ].
7834 7834 I think we will see most governments around the world implementing these kinds of stimulus policies,.
7835 7835 If you have a coordinated stimulus, everyone can maintain an open trading system,.
7836 7836 Trump 's staff believed tariffs would be a win-win and there would be a boost for domestic firms as well as a hit to China, but the first thing just did n't happen. For the past year, U.S. manufacturing has been in recession and shedding jobs, despite the president 's tweets to the contrary.
7837 7837 If you joined the air force the first plane you would walk up to in those days was the Winjeel.
7845 7845 The area under this entire curve is the total number of infections you would expect a single newly infected person to transmit to others at the start of an epidemic, before there have been any interventions,.
7850 7850 I welcome Namo 's statement in Kolkata that History as we know should be reviewed. He should implement that statement by re-naming Victoria Memorial as Rani Jhansi Smarak Mahal,.
7861 7861 Meanwhile, hydrogen and carbon capture are in need of major investment to scale them up and bring down costs. This could be helped by current interest rate levels, which were already low and are declining further, making the financing of big projects more affordable.
7863 7863 If only one of these incidents, geopolitical tensions, had happened a few years ago we would have seen oil prices skyrocket,.
7871 7871 that French economist you think you 've heard about,.
7876 7876 The supply of money collapsed, and the Federal Reserve, which thought it was engaging in a loose monetary policy, in fact it was engaging in a tremendously tightening monetary policy. And that was the big cause of he Great Depression.
7882 7882 It could n't on the way down and it also ca n't on the way up.
7883 7883 The Strategic Toilet Paper Reserve removes the incentive to stockpile. It ensures that even if you see others running to the store to stockpile toilet paper, you no longer need to try to run to beat them. You can relax, knowing that you 'll still be able to wipe your bum,.
7887 7887 His agent read the script and called us and was, like, ` I think Al might like this. I think there is something in this that Al really will respond to.' It was incredibly surreal. And then we had four or five meetings with him before he officially signed on.
7897 7897 Many are not permanently unemployed, but temporarily furloughed. Initial claims of 3.28 million is such a small fraction of 196 that I think we have a lot more to come next week.
7899 7899 racing can continue at this time.
7901 7901 This would follow if the pandemic and containment measures last longer, emerging and developing economies are even more severely hit [ ... ] or if widespread scarring effects emerge due to firm closures and extended unemployment,.
7902 7902 The first priority is clearly to keep people as healthy and safe as possible. Countries can help by spending more to boost their health systems, including on personal protective equipment, screening, diagnostic tests, and additional hospital beds,.
7903 7903 It is very likely that this year the global economy will experience its worst recession since the Great Depression, surpassing that seen during the global financial crisis a decade ago. ` The Great Lockdown', as one might call it, is projected to shrink global growth dramatically.
7904 7904 That would severely reduce productivity in the world, and that is the last thing we want at this time,.
7907 7907 We are nearing the bottom, but no one can specifically point to a bottom. When there is great uncertainty, fear increases. Fear in turn results in retreat.
7909 7909 It was wonderful to see so many great submissions from a wide range of applicants. I could not be more pleased with the strength of this first cohort, and I am delighted that we will have the opportunity to help them develop skills for their chosen career path.
7913 7913 I would advise these schools to consult with the Department of Health and with the local government. But as far as we in DepEd are concerned, since they 're relatively autonomous, they should not miss out on the number of school days for the learners,.
7914 7914 I have not come here to teach, but to learn about the teaching practices of the Baguio City National High School. They might have something to do why they got the highest score in reading. I want to know their secret,.
7915 7915 It 's about bringing humans into a stable economic life, so they can succeed,.
7918 7918 The United States is not seeing CPEC as an economic corridor but a military corridor, as US thinks that the Chinese military would utilize it,.
7919 7919 There are some indications that a recession is imminent,.
7922 7922 This has some of the same feel, some of the feel of panic, some of the feel of volatility you 're talking about. But it 's much closer to a major snowstorm or a natural disaster than it is to a classic 1930s-style depression. So, it 's quite different. Different tools are necessary,.
7927 7927 entitlements [ would ] ever be on your plate ?.
7929 7929 I think the issue of how we provide those supports is an important one in any economic downturn,.
7933 7933 What we are saying here is that that is being complacent because interest rates may not stay low and growth may not stay as high as it is,.
7936 7936 Growth must be visible. Growth must be equitable. Growth must be felt in the lives of people,.
7938 7938 Youth must be prepared for the jobs of the future-not the jobs of the past,.
7940 7940 It 's almost like the way that Republicans failed to react to the Great Depression back in 1929,' 30,' 31, when they also faced something of an extinction event because they simply could n't get off that ideological diet.
7941 7941 Output rose a bit at the end of 2019. Manufacturers seem to be figuring out the new world of trade policy. They are making adjustments to their supply chains,.
7942 7942 Redstor is our partner of choice when it comes to backup and disaster recovery as no other provider can match their level of expertise, product offering, and support. Together, we provide customers with one of the most complete ICT value propositions available in the market currently,.
7944 7944 at least 80 percent likely,.
7950 7950 Because [ Noel is ] greedy and he loves money and he knows that it 's got to happen soon or it wo n't happen.
7951 7951 What if I told you there was a Republican President, but a better version, and you had two-thirds Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress and you had a deficit-to-GDP [ ratio ] of 2, not 4.5 ; and you had a debt-to-GDP [ ratio ] lower than the United States, and 12 times earnings and a 4 % yield-sounds like a decent place to invest to me !.
7952 7952 When you are trying to go after the wealthy, you could potentially hit special interests and then it gets very tricky. How much they will be able to collect is unclear,.
7954 7954 The ACCC can not prevent or take action to stop excessive pricing, as it has no role in setting prices. But in some circumstances excessive pricing may be unconscionable, for example where the product is critical to the health or safety of vulnerable consumers. If a business makes misleading claims about the reason for price increases, it will be breaching the Australian Consumer Law.
7959 7959 I would much rather get people money sooner.
7960 7960 Thrilled to see @ MittRomney proposing $ 1,000 checks. This would [ be ] a critical floor of social insurance for hundreds of millions of Americans and would help the economy rebound more quickly when we are past the virus lockdown phase.
7962 7962 We should certainly be prepared for a meaningful level of deliberate suppression of economic activity for the rest of the year,.
7963 7963 The president 's economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, got asked on television what he thought of my idea. He said something like, ` Jason Furman is my friend, but ...' and then said something much more limited needed to happen.
7971 7971 Iran might also seek to draw Israel into a conflict via Hezbollah in Lebanon,.
7979 7979 Stakeholder capitalism might be accelerated [ by the crisis ],.
7982 7982 In the next couple of weeks our database should be ready. We expect to make a lot of progress this week and then next week we should be able to see the beginning of the new system.
7983 7983 We truly regret that this sort of incident keeps repeating. It seems to have been caused by ineffective coordination among Malaysian authorities, among other things,.
7990 7990 We believe that if we are able to offer a return on investment to our shareholders and offer quality service and convenience to members, they will be happy with Unaitas in its current form,.
7992 7992 Our best and only response to it should be to take concerted action. The COVID Action Platform is at the centre of our mission and we draw upon all our members and partners, communities and capabilities to make it a success.
7996 7996 [ I ] t is ultimately quite strange that people should so ` accept' to occupy themselves in the service of a desire that was not originally their own.
7999 7999 I think most of us think that we are well-calibrated now,.
8000 8000 Right now I 'm thinking about that as a risk,.
8002 8002 Nevertheless, some long-lasting effects arising from the trade war are likely,.
8006 8006 It 's probably the most hopeless art heist in history.
8007 8007 It 's not just like you can say, ` Oh, I ca n't get a job that I want' -- it 's that you ca n't get a job at all.
8013 8013 I may not be a great singer, but I sing with passion,.
8016 8016 On suspected violation of some agreement, those involved post their opinions to this digital court. The court algorithmically aggregates the parties' opinions and judges who violated their agreement. If the digital court judges that a party violated the agreement, the party is fined by withholding a deposit made during the initial agreement.
8017 8017 Stability in China in and of itself is n't good or bad for the world,.
8019 8019 There are some operations in the San Juan basin [ in New Mexico and Colorado ] but it 's not clear to me that they could beat those out either.
8020 8020 conviction ( would ) eventually be overturned, especially if Pakistan comes off the FATF grey list ?.
8022 8022 Has anyone looked into whether there is something in the genetics of Italians which makes this worse ? Are n't there a lot of Italians in NY ?.
8023 8023 have enough cash on the sidelines to meet their one-to-two-year burn rate or spend policy,.
8024 8024 Napoleon is known for his books that deal with self-help, self-improvement and the path to success. I was super curious to find it after my school 's librarian summarised the author and his advanced yet simplified vision. Unfortunately, I could n't find it and as time passed the idea of finding the book was lost,.
8027 8027 Whether its staff, students, faculty or just people in Oakland in general, we 're just trying to make an impact in the community so people know what 's going on around them.
8028 8028 I think that some people just cast us off like, ` Oh, it 's just a college newspaper,' but I think we do a really good job of telling the stories here,.
8029 8029 A final example relates to the civil services reform. Prime Minister Modi has pushed for lateral entry at the top levels of the bureaucracy for several years. But going by publicly available information, it is a reasonable conclusion that bureaucracy slowed down the process to such a degree that it was only at the very end of his term that nine officers could be inducted from outside,.
8035 8035 The best-case scenario would be a downturn that is more severe than the ( 2008 global financial crisis ) ... but shorter-lived, allowing for a return to positive growth by the fourth quarter of this year.
8040 8040 They are making the same serious category error as they did in the Greek crisis in 2010. They are treating an insolvency crisis as if it were a liquidity crisis,.
8048 8048 That 's not zero percent, but as humanly possible to zero as you can get,.
8051 8051 Whether the borders are shut or not, international supply chains are disrupted, we can make sure we can get the key things Australians needs,.
8054 8054 A lukewarm response to our launch would result in huge negative cash flows, and hurt the future success of this development. Critically, we believe we have a very prime site where the land will only get more valuable over time. So, in essence, time is on our side.
8056 8056 I learned a lot playing at this level. Mistakes and poor starts are punished. That should stand to me for the new season and I ca n't wait to get going.
8058 8058 We probably could n't have done this 10 years ago.
8060 8060 There 's time to address our fiscal challenges and fiscal policy could be used as a tool to address other challenges facing the nation if the Congress chooses to do so,.
8061 8061 As it did in the past, if there were an overshoot, the MPC would need to assess the speed with which to return inflation to target,.
8062 8062 For images that are misidentified by the AI, a person would be able to go in and file it correctly,.
8063 8063 Knowing the White Wing course at Rio Verde, we have been working in putts from off the green, bumps, and iron distance control. This tournament should be ideal for us as we start the spring semester. The field is good, the course sets up well for our golfers and we 've had some great practice sessions preparing for some specifics we 'll see here.
8068 8068 Secondly, the brain rapidly acclimates or desires these high levels of dopamine, inducing cravings and making it very hard to kick a cocaine habit to the curb.
8069 8069 What that means is announcing now that the government is ready to do whatever it takes to support the economy. If the impact of COVID-19 shuts down businesses and reduces demand, the government must provide short-term support,.
8076 8076 But even by the end of next year I think we are still going to be looking at something like a 6 per cent unemployment rate,.
8077 8077 There 's no question that if it goes on for four to six months, it will be catastrophic,.
8079 8079 After all, what was the point ? The goal of risk mitigation must be to achieve the portfolio effect of raising the compound annual growth rate ( CAGR ), and thus the wealth in the end user 's entire portfolio, by mitigating risk in that portfolio.
8081 8081 There is skepticism about whether central bank actions can mitigate a virus related shock,.
8088 8088 Whatever Sir Fazle Abed thought and did was about the welfare of the common people. He designed all his programmes accordingly.
8091 8091 If you had 30 to 40 billionaires that decided to do this in 30 to 40 places that had some tech activity,.
8096 8096 It would help the employer sort of have the cash they need to keep workers around for a few months, and so that would be the kind of thing that I would advocate.
8099 8099 This is me really making a start in terms of cross country but having been on the hills I was well aware of the challenge that Angela would present.
8100 8100 You could see how the war had devastated the city,.
8101 8101 Abela faces the great challenge of initiating a political restart in Malta. A restart is only possible if he clearly distances himself from the old system of corruption and clientelism,.
8111 8111 So far, it 's been very successful in helping our patients suffering from substance abuse, while generating substantial revenue. Our technology can be used alongside medical treatment for a wide variety of addictive conditions, including alcohol, opioid and benzodiazepine ( benzo ) addictions.
8112 8112 The second question is, can we find enough early educators that will work to really staff these centers ? We hope so.
8114 8114 But even with technological improvements, it will only happen if the policymakers want it to happen.
8118 8118 Very few people have reached Mr. Patterson 's level of success or had such a profound impact on education and the lives of students.
8120 8120 We are saying that if you live in a country where it 's very prevalent that there is interaction across generations, where grandparents typically pick up kids at school, then, if a situation like this arises, maybe your policy measures should be different.
8127 8127 Chiefs are instrumental agents of development and should not be caught up in the web of partisan politics. We need our chiefs to use their social networking and communications skills to attract development into their communities,.
8128 8128 GA-ASI 's commitment to providing the best available RPA technology to Belgian Defense means identifying and establishing relationships with companies across Belgium that can assist us with that effort,.
8129 8129 It 's magical when you sit there and realize this piece of music would n't have been written,.
8131 8131 We have attracted huge amount of funding because we invested in this and the day we stop doing that and think only about collecting bins and dog waste will be a sad day, because no one else will do it,.
8141 8141 Spend what you can but keep the receipts,.
8145 8145 If they have the educational background, there 's no reason to think that they wo n't be able to do the job. They just need a chance.
8147 8147 Why I worry so much about debt in low-income countries, because what it means is that if it is not proper managed, interest rates, often high, takes away precious resources from education and health and infrastructure investments,.
8151 8151 This is because the introduction of fiscal stimulus measures may raise the risk of a debt crisis once the coronavirus epidemic is over ; such a prospect would have a devastating effect on global growth,.
8153 8153 Without measures by governments, cheaper energy always leads consumers to use it less efficiently. It reduces the appeal of buying more efficient cars or retrofitting homes and offices to save energy. This would be very bad news, since improvements in energy efficiency, a vital element for reaching international climate goals, have already been weakening in recent years,.
8157 8157 The current decline in global emissions is not a development we should be happy abou .... This is happening because of a major economic meltdown, and not as a result of well-designed energy policies.
8164 8164 I 'd do a record, but listen, it depends on what kind of record it is. If it 's anything like that shit he 's putting out at the moment, I do n't think anyone wants that. I think people would give you £ 100 million not to fucking make that record, you know what I mean ? They 'd just go ` yeah, look, here 's £ 100 million quid for the tour and here 's another £ 100 million quid to not make a record like that,.
8173 8173 I know its old-fashioned technology, but you may find ... it 's probably usually worth that phone call. Or visiting the hotel website itself if you do n't like making phone calls.
8174 8174 We will be looking at the market very closely, to determine if further sustained reductions in international prices are being passed onto consumers, and we will be publicly identifying those retailers that are not passing on reductions.
8179 8179 At a time of crisis such as in war or with a pandemic, where there is a common enemy to fight for the nation 's survival, and so a sense of national purpose, co-ordination is both efficient and carries little or no downside, ... It is important that these short-term measures do not give rise to long-term structural damage to competition, market concentration or long-term arrangements that make it more difficult for businesses to enter and compete into the future.
8181 8181 I do n't think anybody, including the First Minister, thinks there 's actually going to be a referendum this year,.
8182 8182 More than 1,000 factories were created in the last Mahama administration. NPP had the slogan for it, which of course people can remember. NDC did not have a slogan for it.
8183 8183 They are not writing off the loans yet, but asking banks and NBFCs to allow a moratorium of 3 months on repayment of term loans. The government will assess the situation as and when, but I think the time period of 3 months is fine for now,.
8184 8184 ... if households have run down their savings and had to dip into retirement savings, or are behind on their bills, and have higher debt and lower wealth, their spending patterns are not likely to go back to what they were .....
8185 8185 Technologies developed in one place of the world need to be and can be applied throughout the world, and become the base for further progress of technological innovation,.
8187 8187 I thought it was important, and we had n't done enough,.
8188 8188 minorities are significantly under represented. They reveal little or no progress in recent decades,.
8193 8193 Yet it appears that ... the number of vacancies of this office has been reduced to 11, the lowest among all RBI offices in 2020, generating a sense of discrimination from a pan-India institution such as the RBI.
8194 8194 If we adhere to Parks Canada 's schedule, we will finish on schedule,.
8199 8199 The impact could be temporary and limited for both the European and the Italian economy to a few decimal of a percentage point in terms of lower growth in the aggregate demand,.
8201 8201 Top of the list is frequent hand washing, hand sanitizing, or both,.
8212 8212 We usually use it if we need a momentum shift or something like that,.
8214 8214 Because of their special vulnerabilities and needs as adolescents, the use of these [ punitive ] approaches is a cruel and harmful practice ... and can have long-term deleterious consequences that are difficult to remediate,.
8217 8217 I think that can be sustained for a while, and so in that context, I think our policy stance of stability makes a lot of sense.
8218 8218 I think this is going to be a short-term hit. We 'll get the economy back to its usual level.
8221 8221 side of my chest or on my bum.
8224 8224 One reason unionized public-sector workers may be unwilling to fully pay for premium increases with reduced wages is that the higher premiums reflect things they do not fully value,.
8229 8229 I am delighted that the work of arguably the single most influential British artist of all time will now appear on another two billion works of art -- the new £ 20 notes that people can start using tomorrow.
8230 8230 I absolutely disagree with divestment campaigns. The whole point of the ( climate finance ) measures are to ensure that investors and banks have the information they need to finance all companies who are improving carbon efficiency whether they are in the oilsands or renewable energy.
8234 8234 from a system of multilateralism where we all had broadly similar rules, whether in trade or finance or, to some extent, in security, to a much more fragmented system.
8235 8235 Persistent weakness could require a prompt response.
8239 8239 Chinese economic recovery may be much weaker than expected.
8240 8240 The industry that is supposed to improve our health is undermining it.
8246 8246 What matters is that the rate of increase of confirmed US cases is not yet slowing. Yesterday 's 33 % increase would, if sustained, lead to the number of cases doubling every 2.9 days. At that pace, total U.S. cases would reach 1.3 mln by April 8. Right now, global cases stand at 537K,.
8249 8249 earnings will crater from the first quarter onwards, but should begin to recover by the end of the year,.
8251 8251 It does seem, though, from data earlier in the outbreak, that cases in large outbreaks double every three our four days. That means, in theory, that an outbreak of 1,000 cases becomes more than a million cases after just 33-to-44 days.
8252 8252 The latest actions from the Fed and the likelihood of further substantial fiscal support mean that the risk of an uncontained failure of the economy beyond, say, the end of May, has greatly diminished,.
8264 8264 The government must use the impending total lock-down to reset and adopt the UK model of a job and wages guarantee.
8267 8267 I do n't see anything right now that suggests to me inflation is going to run away on the top side,.
8268 8268 I think we have to open up again in some way, because otherwise the collateral damage is going to be incredible. You think about the people who live day to day ... you got to get the economy going again.
8274 8274 The wealth effect, the rising stock market should be adding about half a point of GDP growth in 2019 and are on track to do about the same in 2020,.
8280 8280 The second half of next year should be strong in terms of growth, and I expect 2022 to be a very good year for growth. But we wo n't get back to full employment until well into 2023,.
8284 8284 This is a good example of how international cooperation and local know-how can make tangible improvement for people and businesses alike, and at the same time, contributes to climate action and protection of the environment. I am very proud to see cooperation between Europe and India growing through projects like this.
8287 8287 To get the price of electricity down to € 0.02 or € 0.03 per kWh is going to be an enormous, enormous challenge,.
8288 8288 Whatever is missed out on for a couple of months will come up strongly with a rebound in autumn, provided that this situation is of short duration and the stimulus package provides for lost income. That would be the best-case scenario.
8291 8291 The state of housing in 2020 will depend on whether home builders bring more affordable homes to the market,.
8292 8292 Younger workers, with more years of service ahead of them, would experience even larger cumulative income losses.
8297 8297 It 's ridiculous when he 's just lost us another election. It 's also a crying shame. Yvette is one of the few grown-ups we 've got left -- she 's probably our best chance.
8298 8298 So reforming Econ 101 could be a small, but important part of solving the pipeline problem.
8303 8303 As soon as people see line-ups, empty shelves, it triggers our inner panic button. We wonder are we missing out on something and we immediately figure out that perhaps we should line up.
8306 8306 There 's enough to be sold. As shelves get replenished, I think people will get disciplined a bit more and there will be more [ limits on buying essential items ] as well,.
8307 8307 The luxury that Starbucks has that other chains may not have, is that they can move price points more easily .... People expect to pay more. That 's a luxury that Starbucks has,.
8308 8308 The practice, if done at the right time, will be seen as a responsible one,.
8309 8309 Census agencies worldwide report difficulties encouraging those in their late teens and 20s to complete their forms. We suspect that the Jedi response was most common in precisely this age group,.
8314 8314 Governing Council will be watching closely to see if the recent slowdown in growth is more persistent than forecast. In assessing incoming data, the Bank will be paying particular attention to developments in consumer spending, the housing market, and business investment.
8315 8315 Should this housing rebound continue, we will be watching for signs of extrapolative expectations returning to certain major housing markets -- in other words, froth.
8322 8322 Several Allies, or all Allies, actually, supported the decision to do more and also to take over some of the activities which is today conducted by the U.S.-led Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS,.
8325 8325 And then there 's also 6 billion dollars from the International Finance Corporation. That 's critical because it 's private sector financing, it 's fast acting and it takes the form of trade finance and working capital finance, which are some of the most needed services that can be provided during this crisis.
8329 8329 Facts & documents are the basis for sound judgements. If you wonder whether the @ WHO engaged in a # Chinese cover up exercise, is just incompetent, or both, take a look at the WHO 's tweet from Jan 14th,.
8331 8331 Everyone would see the wisdom of this simple, easy-to-use calendar,.
8332 8332 I saw vestiges of the nightmarish world she had survived. It was an experience that forever altered the course of my life. It was the moment consecrated in time and memory that I sought to make good on doing my part -- however big or however small -- to ensure the promise of ` Never Again.' I believed then -- as I do now -- that I had a responsibility as the grandson of Holocaust survivors to keep their stories alive.
8334 8334 They 're often nebbishes or Woody Allen or very intellectual. But to have power to reclaim your place and get justice for your ancestors is definitely a wish fulfilment. And that 's what Hunters became.
8340 8340 It means that we can go into Saturday 's game against Huntingdon looking to get a result and then take things through to the end of the season.
8342 8342 Congress leaders have to reinvent themselves. Otherwise, we are staring at irrelevance. Our arrogance has to go, even after six years out of power sometimes, some of us behave as if we are still ministers,.
8343 8343 all senior Congress leaders, after a certain age, should be mentoring juniors rather than tormenting them.
8345 8345 There were two Menons out there, Patel 's key adviser was VP Menon and Nehru 's key adviser was Krishna Menon. Krishna Menon did not like V P Menon and the feeling was mutual. Mountbatten used to get along with both. V P Menon would meet Mountbatten to tell him what Patel thought and Krishna Menon would meet him to tell him what Nehru thought,.
8350 8350 the duration should be much shorter than the Great Depression.
8354 8354 If actually in the extreme you look at Italy, or you look at Greece, their per capita income today is lower than it was in 2007. And if you believe the IMF forecasts, in 2024 they 'll still be lower than they were in 2007. So that is the setting for this kind of your de-globalization attitude.
8355 8355 If Shabbar Zaidi does not recover then we will look for a replacement. His return would be determined by the doctor.
8357 8357 If you want to have this crisis followed by populist governments, right-wing governments,.
8358 8358 is probably good enough,.
8360 8360 The shock to the financial position of the corporate sector may leave lasting scars on investment,.
8361 8361 That scenario would entail a 3.5 % contraction in 2020 GDP in the Eurozone and a 2.0 % fall for the UK before a solid rebound in 2021. The rebound would carry on with above-trend gains in GDP from a still low level in 2022. Ultimately, however, the impact of COVID-19 will be temporary. Increasingly, policymakers are showing that they are ready to do what it takes to avoid a 2008/09-style scenario,.
8365 8365 There we laid down a two-fold reduction in the size of insurance premiums for SMEs from 30 to 15 % as of April 1, if the employee 's salary exceeds the minimum wage,.
8366 8366 So we should find a way to increase SDRs or for the Europeans to offer their SDRs as a way out.
8373 8373 We know our fans will not want to miss any games played in the coming months ... but clearly we must all play our part in the efforts to combat coronavirus,.
8378 8378 People should not be trivialising this disease -- while it is for most a mild to moderate illness, for some it 's not,.
8379 8379 It is a question of when, not if, we see community transmission in Northern Ireland.
8380 8380 I think we will inevitably see cases at some stage ... It should come as no surprise when we get our our first case,.
8386 8386 She never loses sight of the big picture -- what she 's learning and how it might contribute to solving vexing issues in our society, particularly as they relate to populations that have been marginalized in one way or another,.
8392 8392 If you are running for president of the United States, you need to be at the table,.
8395 8395 If we are right, which we believe we are, these actions are unconscionable under any measure,.
8399 8399 By Wednesday, March 18th at 12:30 p.m., when I appeared on CNBC, we had already sold slightly more than half of the notional amount of our CDS, realising a gain of more than $ US1.3 billion, with the unrealized portion of our hedge having a market value at that time of $ US1.3 billion for a total of $ US2.6 billion,.
8400 8400 Everyone assumes I would be gushing over the global rollout of working from home,.
8401 8401 It depends on whether the Iranians feel they must retaliate against America or against Trump. If it 's Trump, then any response may well be timed to affect the 2020 elections.
8404 8404 ` It 's shameful that while big business has license to run amok trying to bully or buy politicians ... working people have to follow the most onerous of restrictions,.
8407 8407 It 's a think tank, there 's plenty of room for all of them. From that side of the spectrum all the way over to Joe Manchin,.
8411 8411 These data all show that, over time, we have become much less vulnerable to weather and climate, partly because economic growth has meant that we can afford to better protect ourselves, and partly because technology is so much better now.
8412 8412 The same government that increased the maximum speed and promoted it as one of its national achievements ... now lowered the maximum speed. It shows that if you really want to you can do things that have never been done before,.
8415 8415 Not only should it 's provisions be put into effect right now to address current supply chain gaps, but also to ensure that in future pandemics, America has the supplies it needs,.
8416 8416 As thousands of Furness people walk into work again tomorrow. I ask the question is Furness General Hospital going to be big enough or will a large section of our community end up in temporary beds in the empty school halls ?.
8419 8419 If you overdo it, you panic everybody. If you underdo it, they get complacent. You have to be careful,.
8421 8421 Local NGOs had demonstrated convincingly that the metro train sheds could be built elsewhere, without ecological losses to Aarey, but it seemed that the temptation of land-grab from nature was apparently too much. This is a familiar story in India and elsewhere,.
8423 8423 Muslim students who were fasting during the month of Ramadan -- the school should make opportunities for them if they do n't want to be in the cafeteria during the lunch hour, but want to be in the library or something like that,.
8428 8428 We are in the business of allowing unalloyed, unarmed truth to have the final word, we are in the business to ensure Julian 's sentence will end neither with a bang or with a whimper, but with a magnificent full stop,.
8431 8431 I think the more victims come out and show their face -- ` Hey I 'm a real person, I 'm not just Jane Doe,' you know, maybe the DA will listen to that,.
8433 8433 It is necessary to emphasise the subtleties of the innovative forces of the opposition ... We need to know more about what I am protesting about. The head must also join with the heart in protest,.
8435 8435 You ( UP CM ) have declared yourself mandatory to wear masks since yesterday. Please ensure distribution of war-level masks and sanitizers and people should be told clearly where and how they will get masks and sanitizers,.
8438 8438 Powell 's statement is a strong signal that the Fed is about to cut rates, and it is highly likely that this will be a series of cuts,.
8440 8440 Announcement is still a tightening of liquidity and near-term, we would expect market interest rates to adjust to this.
8442 8442 I thought about it for a while and said I did not think a resignation was appropriate. I wondered then, whether I was simply saying what I thought he would like to hear but on reflection I am convinced I gave him honest advice,.
8446 8446 I remember after 2007, 2008 when the interest rate on regular deposits in banks went down so much that a lot of young people, in particular in the U.S., said, ` Why should I save ?.
8447 8447 How many in the last month have exercised less than they think they should ? How many of you in the last month have not slept enough ?.
8449 8449 In six months' time you may ask whether to keep some restrictions at some economic cost because a vaccine might come along, or say we should live with it as long as it 's contained and controlled and just deal with localised outbreaks and accept the negative health consequences. That 'd be a reasonable public health debate to have in six months -- but not now.
8453 8453 I think that it 's important that we work with other institutions,.
8455 8455 Look I think it is a time of emergency. I am an Indian citizen and I am very, very, closely engaged in seeing what is happening to India and worry about it every day. An Indian citizen when called upon will do what is necessary in a time of need so I do n't think that 's an issue.
8461 8461 Often, when people face debilitating illness or very difficult life events, suicide may come to their minds. Does she agree that at such times, we should provide better mental health support, psychological support and counselling to enable people to come to terms with their feelings and look much more positively towards their abilities and the contribution they make ?.
8467 8467 a global effort must ensure that when therapies and vaccines are developed for Covid-19 both rich and poor nations alike have immediate access.
8478 8478 A lot of businesses know their revenue is n't going back to February levels by the beginning of May, so they might be better off using other provisions of the CARES Act, like the expanded unemployment benefits,.
8479 8479 It reminds us to take a moment and think about the kind of strides women have made in the labor market,.
8482 8482 There has been barely any reduction in inequality, which continues to have a negative effect on peace and security. We need collaboration in research and advocacy from our institutions to ensure that we can tackle the challenges of climate change, food insecurity, disease outbreaks and the push for industrialisation that will help us meet the SDGs,.
8487 8487 Based on new GDP forecasts, we project that nearly 20 million workers will be laid off or furloughed by July, with losses in every state,.
8488 8488 There 's no reason to wait a week because you can start getting those benefits a soon as possible. It 's good for you, it 's good for the economy.
8489 8489 It 's a little bit like, when you discover sex can be dangerous, you do n't come out and say, ` There should be no more sex.' You should give people guidance on how to have sex less dangerously.
8492 8492 There may not be anyone there to help them becom e a composer,.
8496 8496 Countries that are serious about using carbon markets to increase ambition should move forward to set their own strong rules for high-integrity international emissions trading, paving the way for faster, deeper cuts in GHGs,.
8500 8500 If you look at what happened in 2003, estimates range from [ reducing GDP in China ] by 0.5 % to 2 %, half a percent for Southeast Asia, and the stock markets sold off double digits,.
8504 8504 Judging by past episodes it 's likely that the impact will ultimately be temporary,.
8508 8508 You might ask why that has n't happened in Wuhan,.
8511 8511 The Supreme Court decision is a welcome development to us. It reaffirms our belief that we are in the right path when we stand to defend that marriage is just and must be confined between man and woman. It is not only the divine will of God, it is also the standing spirit and will of the laws of our land,.
8517 8517 I think it 's important to contribute to the society in our small, kind of modest way,.
8520 8520 It may involve breaking ties between roughly equal applicants. But if a school is making major concessions to a less-qualified applicant, that 's difficult to justify.
8524 8524 What he has n't shown is that his tariff-based strategy can generate a revival in U.S. manufacturing.
8526 8526 An Agriculture Bill that puts improving the environment at its core is to be applauded, but we desperately need to understand if future UK trading arrangements will help or hinder the opportunities offered within it,.

8534 8534 There may be an increase in unintentional harm.
8535 8535 While this support could prove lasting in [ the second half of 2020 ], the accompanying supply cuts would remain much too small to offset the current 8 million bpd hit on demand from coronavirus.
8536 8536 At Hong Kong Disneyland, we currently estimate the closure of the park could have an additional adverse impact to operating income of about US $ 40 million for the second quarter.
8543 8543 Right now, grocery stores are missing many crucial items, such as milk, bread, potatoes, and basic medical supplies that consumers are now forced to find by visiting two or more retail outlets, sometimes without success,.
8548 8548 We build packages we think are the best way to solve problems, or best for the most people to learn R,.
8558 8558 Peak oil will not happen before 2040 because even if light vehicles go electric there will be increased demand from aviation, ships and trucks as well as the petrochemical industry. That may be good news for the Middle East, but it 's bad news for the planet.
8561 8561 Finally, and I think belatedly, the wheels ... of U.S. machinery -- industry, government, the central bank, everybody -- is going to be wheeling together, and when those wheels begin turning, I think we 're going to see all kinds of things.
8562 8562 It 's probably a little too early to see the jump in unemployment. The market is expecting unemployment to go from 5.1 per cent in February to around 5.5 per cent, so not a dreadful number,.
8568 8568 The project may be hampered a little [ if things do not improve ].
8570 8570 trust the statistics on GDP growth or on inflation.
8572 8572 As in, ` He 's a stats guy' or ` He 's a policy guy,.
8576 8576 We can have at most two of these three things,.
8577 8577 Well, this is the seventh step. First, it must be ensured that no more weapons are exported to this region. That would already be an essential step.
8584 8584 I think by the time we get to Easter we are going to probably see about 1.5 to 1.8 million job losses due to stand downs. That would see the unemployment rate soar from 5.1 per cent as of February to somewhere above, between 15 and 17 per cent.
8588 8588 block grants are just a Republican trick to slash spending without appearing to do so.
8590 8590 I think the predictions of a quick economic collapse were too optimistic,.
8593 8593 They may unlock new opportunities for efficiency and inclusion, but this can only happen with the appropriate infrastructure and guardrails.
8594 8594 We 're so far beyond democratic practice when people are talking about purely partisan judges, and when the Justice Department is being run by the President of the United States, we 're talking about a monarchy or something like it.
8596 8596 For decades, economists had this view that burdens could quote - ` help' separate out those that are what one calls truly disadvantaged versus those who might be more marginally needy,.
8597 8597 It 's clearly a big deal. Even if it 's contained, it will be significant to the global economy.
8600 8600 a whole host of structures and systems that jeopardize the possibility of a future that they believe might be far more just.
8604 8604 good news -- if there is any to be had.
8606 8606 I believe it is partly due to the fact that people simply can not afford [ houses ] and therefore they are putting second thought as to whether they want to move into Boise,.
8609 8609 So, it is no wonder that those living in the West would think that now is a perfect time to place a home on the market. California especially is seeing some of the highest prices ever.
8611 8611 The agenda of silencing the guns must be dealt with in a comprehensive manner,.
8612 8612 Without urgent, ambitious and historic action, we could easily see the biggest humanitarian crisis since World War Two ... We can only beat this pandemic if we act in solidarity with every country and for every person. No one is safe until we are all safe.
8613 8613 If you want to get a sense of what that means, my estimate is that if you could turn the clock back to 2000, if you could return the market to the degree of competition we had 20 years ago, you would essentially increase the income of the median family by about $ 5,000 a year.
8614 8614 In the first instance, this will consist of taking on some of the global coalition 's current training activities. Ministers also agreed to explore what more we can do,.
8618 8618 So Iran must refrain from further violence and provocations.
8623 8623 remain to be seen whether there is still a lot of room for improvement.
8625 8625 That he was a hugely impactful envoy for India in the UK between 1947 and 1950 can stand up to scrutiny. That he unravelled many knotty issues at the UN especially between 1952 and 1957 is also clear,.
8626 8626 I do n't understand what Shaheen Bagh people are protesting about. Are they worried that their citizenship is going to be taken away from them. That is a legitimate fear. Then they should agitate against NPR and NRC. Why are they only agitating against CAA,.
8627 8627 If you want to do something for ( the cause of ) global warming, become a vegetarian. Because I think the beef industry has been a huge culprit in global warming. Two things - a large amount of land are taken up. As you know, cattle population emit methane which is a more powerful greenhouse gas than even carbondioxide.
8629 8629 In the same way that central banks can review their monetary policy framework, I think businesses after this outbreak will likely look at how they are managing their stock, how they are organizing their production throughout the world.
8632 8632 If the virus and the medical response roughly follow this script, then businesses should be largely reopened by the third quarter of this year, resulting in a double-digit bounce in real GDP growth,.
8638 8638 The economy stuck exactly to the script that economists thought it would,.
8639 8639 They are throwing everything they 've got at this. My sense is they must be nervous about the credit system not functioning properly. They are trying to shore up confidence.
8641 8641 Covid-19 will need to break through the job market firewall if it is to do significant damage to the economy,.
8643 8643 following our meeting with Bank of Ireland and trade unions today we are encouraged by the willingness of all parties and the determination of all parties to reach a solution which avoids examinership or liquidation.
8644 8644 If we are to make real progress on continuing the reduction of fatalities on our roads, we need to address the central problem of speeding.
8645 8645 went 99 % of the way to say that the government would n't allow the FAI to go into examinership or insolvency.
8646 8646 people should not and do no need to worry about these things.
8654 8654 For example, coming with the unified tax system, and the demonetisation that took place. These are steps that over time are beneficial, but of course they might, might be somewhat disruptive over a short term,.
8656 8656 We recognize that other scenarios could be significantly more impactful,.
8658 8658 The immediate impact is obvious. We have travel, tourism, manufacturing in China and a little bit beyond China may initially be impacted. China has taken very dramatic actions to restrict the spread of the virus and work is underway on a vaccine. So, let 's say for this quarter there will very likely be a negative impact. What would happen beyond this quarter we must observe and assess,.
8659 8659 There may be a cut that we are still hoping would be in the 0.1 to 0.2 percentage space,.
8664 8664 I urge other member countries to follow the UK 's leadership in contributing to the CCRT. By working together, we can overcome the global challenge facing us and restore growth and prosperity for all.
8667 8667 While some uncertainties -- like disease -- are out of our control, we should not create new uncertainties where we can avoid it.
8671 8671 Let 's remember if there is a country in Europe that has fiscal space, Germany is that country,.
8675 8675 I intend to retire as solo artist after album no3 as I have just had a call from my brother begging me to start Oasis again in 2022 if you believe in life after love c 'm on you know LG x [ sic ].
8677 8677 Wan na clear a few things up oasis gig for NHS charity as in all money raised goes to NHS not to me will happen with or with out Noel Gallagher it may not be the same but trust me it 'll still blow you knickers off as you were LG.
8678 8678 Well he might as well as there no point in plugging his pile of s * * t,.
8680 8680 It may not be the same [ without Noel ], but trust me, it 'll still blow you knickers off. As you were LG x.
8681 8681 The only way this lockdown can get any worse is if the ice cream vans start booting round the streets blasting Rkid 's [ Noel 's ] new tunes.
8687 8687 I understand why many people will view this as quantitative easing -- or QE,.
8688 8688 We enjoy a standard of living in this country that very few countries in the world enjoy. More of us have jobs than ever before. We live in a fantastic, prosperous wealthy country, and I think we should remember that.
8692 8692 She knows all her patients and their families, and nothing is ever too much trouble or too timely. Her beautiful smile, nurturing nature, uplifting spirit and her excellent clinical knowledge and abilities makes her an amazing woman.
8694 8694 Most effective is if it 's broad and brings in many countries.
8697 8697 The poorest and most vulnerable countries will likely be hit the hardest, and our teams around the world remain focused on country-level and regional solutions to address the ongoing crisis,.
8698 8698 we could do even better.
8700 8700 If Zimbabwe is dying, Bulawayo is already dead.
8703 8703 When the United States was negotiating trade agreements with China we did n't pay nearly enough attention to issues like human rights, labor rights, health care, transparency, or environmental rights,.
8710 8710 I am appalled that communication between the administration and the police would be so delayed that ill-treatment of students could go on for quite some time without being prevented by forces of law and order. That the establishment of the university can not prevent outsiders from coming in and creating such bloody violence within the campus,.
8712 8712 I was n't addressing the present political situation in India -- the theme of my talk was ` barriers to friendship', either between nations or within nations, because sectarian and communal conflicts have their bad effect on political and social life. They can also make the development of knowledge and the spread of knowledge much harder,.
8714 8714 I do n't think the policymakers and taxpayers should be making risk takers completely risk neutral.
8716 8716 If we do not pass it, the world will disintegrate, and be incapable to deliver on all the other challenges we have as an interconnected society, such as climate change and social inclusion. The objective of this global effort should not only be to fight the virus, but to alleviate its dire economic and social consequences.
8719 8719 We can not be complacent, we must give the concept of stakeholder response meaning in real life.
8725 8725 This is like the biggest decision you can make in your personal life,.
8729 8729 The study 's researchers offered several possible reasons for the program 's lack of success, including a lack of follow-up home visits or doctor 's appointments or insufficient resources,.
8731 8731 Some children do not have access to the internet, so this is not possible in all places. But our technical people are thinking of ways to conduct [ classes remotely ] even without internet connectivity,.
8738 8738 The economy will recover quickly if we can shut down the virus. And the way to shut down the virus is the ultimate in social distancing, i.e. a total country shutdown.
8742 8742 You can hear it around us. And there 's a lot more work to go. But we feel really good about where we are in getting everything prepared.
8747 8747 It 's not like [ manufacturers ] have a lot of surge capacity they can suddenly bring on. They can maybe work a little bit longer, but most of those plants run 7 by 24 anyways,.
8750 8750 Then it 's probably at risk that people might get into this business just to be paid to stop doing it.
8753 8753 Reagan did not believe in mutually assured destruction. He would not press the button, even if they bombed Washington DC ( What is the point ? ).
8755 8755 Suppose however that from the second quarter, the V shape implies they go back to the previous growth of 6 per cent not 8, then Chinese growth this year will be 2.5 per cent ... and then they have the global spillover and a pandemic,.
8756 8756 But if we have the monetary easing we have right now, if we control the pandemics by doing systematic quarantines, maybe by June-July the pandemic is stopped, and maybe by the fourth quarter of this year we are going to have an economic recovery,.
8757 8757 What we can hope is if there 's going to be the right stimulus -- and it has to be at least 3 % of GDP -- this is going to be a very severe, but short recession.
8761 8761 The Bank of England 's role is to help U.K. businesses and households manage through an economic shock that could prove large but will ultimately be temporary,.
8771 8771 The way this could happen is if the governor says we are not happy with that plan and we are going to decide.
8772 8772 This would decrease not only the spread of coronavirus, but also the flu and other contagious diseases,.
8773 8773 It can be very unhealthy when the situation becomes speculative because it can lead to a sudden downdraft in house prices later, with wider implications for the economy.
8776 8776 The question remains whether governor Poloz and his team will be comfortable with a sub-trend pace of growth amid elevated signs of financial stress and households and tighter financial conditions,.
8784 8784 some high-level conversations about how partnership and collaboration is probably the best pathway to the scale and impact of public media. We talked in broad terms about the opportunity to create a public-media center with KRCC as the anchor and how CPR could bring the resources to make that happen.
8791 8791 in the second quarter we may well see a stock build of over 15 million barrels a day. This is the reason, I think, we need to do more.
8792 8792 Although new forms of short-term flexibility such as battery storage are on the rise, most electricity systems rely on natural gas power plants - which can quickly ramp generation up or down at short notice - to provide flexibility, underlining the critical role of gas in clean energy transitions,.
8793 8793 At a time of such uncertainty and potential vulnerability for the world economy, playing Russian roulette in oil markets may well have grave consequences,.
8795 8795 The only thing I would hope, that in the oil markets, common sense will prevail and all the actors behave responsibly as the world is facing major challenges today,.
8798 8798 About half of that amount would be needed for networks. It can be achieved if policy and regulatory measures improve the financial and operational efficiency of utilities, as well as facilitate the effective use of public funds to catalyse private capital.
8800 8800 rarely rates highly in the international or national consciousness.
8802 8802 We have not been served with any charges by the state, either filed or unfiled. Therefore we have no knowledge of whatever is being discussed. We have also not been invited as to when we are supposed to appear in court to be charged or for the charges to be read to us.
8808 8808 It seems unlikely that we 'll move instantly back to business as usual. We 'll probably be avoiding large crowds for a while,.
8810 8810 The more damage of that sort is done, the more likely we are to see a ` U,' and there are worse letters like ` L,' and I hope we do n't see something like that,.
8812 8812 The IT sector of Punjab depends upon knowledge economy and a proper ecosystem should be in place to cater to the potential talent in this sector,.
8815 8815 Higher prices for advertisers means higher prices for consumers. And lower revenues for ad hosts could in the longer term lead to a reduction in the quality and diversity of online content,.
8816 8816 You may well be seeing an important disparity there, so that is very much a concern and something we 'll be looking at very closely and something the government will be looking at no doubt,.
8817 8817 A loan may allow them to cover certain fixed costs, such as rent, but it will not make up for the lost revenue,.
8818 8818 If people are able to spread it outside of the flu season, then this has legs through the summer and you 're absolutely looking at a recession globally.
8819 8819 We 're going to have to either have a Great Depression, or figure out a way to send people back to work even though that 's risky,.
8820 8820 If these allegations turn out to be true, this is a major scandal,.
8827 8827 On all of those measures, I think it has to be regarded as a very good package,.
8830 8830 But they 're pretty modest impacts. I think the real one is corporate failure,.
8842 8842 The report highlights that the U.S. and Europe will suffer deeper declines than the rest of the world. I think this is accurate,.
8843 8843 Well, I would n't put it that way because we 're pretty murderous also. We 've launched more wars than any other country in modern times,.
8847 8847 If things calm down on the risk front, I think you 'll probably see the dollar gain some ground, especially if all this Fed easing that has been priced in gets priced out,.
8848 8848 But it is still too soon to even speculate about either the size or persistence of these effects, or whether it will lead to a material change in the outlook.
8850 8850 Investment in protective equipment and tests would be a far less expensive, better way to stimulate the economy than giveaways and transfers.
8855 8855 Do n't for forget going into this offer, there were concerns about timing, an election year, and you would have expected some hesitancy, but all these did not affect interest in the Eurobond.
8857 8857 The measures may include withdrawal from the Ghana Stabilization Fund occasioned by anticipated shortfalls in the ABFA. We will come to this august House to seek for the necessary approvals when it is necessary in due course.
8858 8858 I do n't see myself as a designer. In my view, all the jeans, all the fits, and all the washes have been made in the past, even before I was born. But we can fine-tune the jeans, fits, and washes to make them even better. Therefore, I would say Saburo is an industrially developed brand. And I am a developer of jeans.
8859 8859 I do n't think the economy is fundamentally imbalanced or at a fragile position at this point,.
8860 8860 If our current forecast is realized it seems appropriate to characterize it as a novel-global recession ... Our forecast for a mid-year growth rebound would not fit the NBER criteria that recessions should last for more than a few months. JPMorgan expects a fading of the coronavirus outbreak to promote a recovery in activity into midyear 2020, followed by an acceleration in growth in the second half of the year.
8864 8864 we should see these debt levels coming down,.
8867 8867 The question is : whether this will move outside of China and become a pandemic. And so we can think of really downside, dire scenarios where things could go bad.
8868 8868 I do n't have anything specific on the particular issue at this point but I can say that globally there have been issues of social unrest that have impacted growth. For example, social unrest in Chile has significantly impacted its growth. The same is true for Hong Kong.
8870 8870 If you look at the business cycle phenomena in India, typically if you look at the peaks and troughs and co-relate it with what has happened, it seems like we have hit the trough therefore there should be uptick in growth. That is what we are budgeting,.
8871 8871 Other than getting rid of our ridiculous interprovincial barriers, governments across country should think twice before making market conditions conducive to allowing more players on the market.
8874 8874 Do n't get me wrong, I do think we should recognize the legacy of the micro-brewery movement, it 's been important,.
8891 8891 Open-ended QE -- this always looked inevitable -- plus purchases of both primary and secondary market corporate bonds, and bond ETFs, for investment grade businesses ( BBB/Baa3 or above ) represents a huge easing.
8892 8892 You have to be willing to think what previously would have been unthinkable.
8894 8894 The consensus was a bad joke but the initial hit from bar and restaurant closures was bigger still than we expected. Next week 's number, however, will be an order of magnitude worse. Media reports from around the country make it clear that claims have rocketed since bars and restaurants started to close in large numbers over the weekend, in some cases by a factor of 10 or more.
8895 8895 The rate of growth of cases in western Europe has stalled at about 15 % per day. Next week should be better. The UK is yet to see any slowdown ; cases are rising by about 20 % per day. That 's to be expected given the lockdown began only on Monday ; we look for a clear slowing by the end of next week,.
8899 8899 My visit to Kauda is a step towards recognising this. Peace can only happen with our commitment as a government and as a people to finding solutions to the conflict,.
8905 8905 The central bank will continue to intervene through the spot market, domestic non-deliverables forward and bonds if needed.
8906 8906 The climate that seems to reign among heads of state and government and the lack of European solidarity pose a mortal danger to the European Union,.
8908 8908 This one could be appealing in its speed of execution and simplicity,.
8911 8911 Vegetables are daily essentials. Everyone needs that every day. If supplies are disrupted, whatever limited supplies are coming, at the wholesale level, higher prices will be charged. It is a very murky situation at present. Wholesale prices depend on whether things are moving or not,.
8912 8912 Some of that may be attributable to prices. Thus, 2015-16 and 2016-17 recorded a consumption drop alongside double-digit dal inflation. The peak consumption in 2017-18 was when prices actually dipped 20.8 per cent year-on-year.
8914 8914 if we had the same ratios of CEO to worker pay as fifty years ago.
8915 8915 Youth must be prepared for the jobs of the future -- not the jobs of the past,.
8917 8917 The call for higher interest rates should instead be directed at governments and legislators, combined with the urgent demand for measures to strengthen the growth potential of our economies.
8918 8918 ( The ECB ) stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as needed ... to avoid fragmentation that may hamper the smooth transition of our monetary policy,.
8921 8921 The worker is sort of forced to choose between their livelihood or going to work ill and then exposing their coworkers, or in some cases the public, to that illness,.
8924 8924 I do not eat my own cooking. Funny thing about money. If I started to worry about my own profit and loss, I would be less concentrated on my customers' well-being,.
8925 8925 I think the signature is a feel-good thing but it does n't actually do anything to prove who anybody is,.
8930 8930 Whether a mass gathering refers to workers in an office building or a court house or a school, they ( health authorities ) will make that decision over the weekend,.
8933 8933 These bureaucrats and politicians who think panic is lines at Costco and angry parents when a school is closed, may find out that panic is when you are taking mum to the emergency room and she dies in the parking lot because no one can see her. I hope this does not happen and we get lucky, but all signs point the other direction.
8938 8938 He assumed, in a speech delivered before he left for the funeral of his best friend, as he said, that the contents of this envelope relates to his secret recording of proceedings of top-level collective bodies of the European Union and thus apparently gave me the right, as he said, before leaving for the funeral of his best friend, the right to decide if I will pass it on to party leaders,.
8940 8940 If there 's a recession coming because the supply side of the economy has been hurt badly, for example because people are n't able to go to work, the Fed is n't going to put people back to work by lowering rates,.
8945 8945 hard to imagine that you would go negative to, say, minus 5 percent.
8947 8947 I think negative regional prices here ( and elsewhere in landlocked production jurisdictions ) are very possible, potentially inevitable,.
8948 8948 By directing federal agencies to disregard long-term and cumulative impacts of projects, this proposal takes a sledgehammer to decades of legal precedence and puts our communities at risk. It is like putting permanent blinders on, and ignoring reality when deciding whether to build a project. This proposal is particularly dangerous for frontline and vulnerable communities that have already been disproportionately exposed to pollution, such as air pollutants from nearby highways or legacy pollutants from industrial sites.
8950 8950 This will ensure that environmental violations can be investigated and remedied in a substantive and timely manner.
8951 8951 We need somebody who can help restore our standing in the world,.
8954 8954 Instead of transmitting these materials to OIRA as part of the interagency review process, which is a standard and lawful process that would also result in their public release once the rule is finalized, hard copies of these materials are being shared only with the Department of Transportation.
8956 8956 Unfortunately, if this rule is finalized, I fear the result will be just the opposite.
8963 8963 We have plenty of hogs, chickens and cows. But they all have to go through these packing plants that are big enough that if one closes down because workers get sick, it 's not a trivial amount.
8964 8964 A lower policy rate can not prevent the coronavirus outbreak from having a substantial impact on the Norwegian economy, but it could dampen the downturn and mitigate the risk of more persistent effects on output and employment,.
8967 8967 The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget the Tesla [ value investors ] shorted here,.
8968 8968 There may not be anyone there to help them become a composer,.
8974 8974 You could avoid the pain and still get your benefit.
8975 8975 As you may know, Russia 's Aerospace Force is getting ready to evacuate ( 133-TASS ) Russians from Wuhan and Hubei province. The evacuation will take place on February 3-5,.
8976 8976 computerization should have little effect on the percentage of the workforce engaged in these tasks.
8978 8978 no one, if we 're starting a new school district would say ` let 's start high school at 7:40 or 7:50.
8979 8979 people would be sad and crying.
8988 8988 Although it 's not the moment now to end the lockdown we need to think about where we are going to be in two, three, four weeks' time and now start looking at that plan, being able to scrutinise that plan so we get it right,.
8989 8989 It 's clear that many businesses are still not doing the right thing. This must change now. This is a health emergency -- it can not be business as usual.
8990 8990 No one talks about what suit or tie a man is wearing. Everyone needs to focus on what really matters.
8992 8992 at a minimum, I would say that it needs to be clarified.
8995 8995 We are absolutely supportive of any other proposal brought forward either at the city or county level,.
8996 8996 We expect he would be less aggressive on China than Trump or the left-wing Democrats and especially to promote cooperation with the EU,.
9001 9001 I think it was a timeous decision and I applaud the committee for taking such proactive measures to help consumers and small businesses survive within the current circumstances,.
9002 9002 We need a circuit breaker, which could be news about a vaccine, better news about mortality rates, or news about the spread of the virus beginning to slow down globally.
9003 9003 Air pollution is an established risk factor for cardiovascular health and because CVD accelerates cognitive decline, we believe exposure to air pollution might negatively affect cognition indirectly. In our study, virtually all of the association of air pollution with dementia seemed to be through the presence or the development of CVD.
9005 9005 The current market turmoil tells me a new era is breaking, so question everything. Will cable, energy, mobile and social medias ever come back ? And if not, what 's next ?.
9009 9009 One point to get across is no one intervention or change is going to solve the problem,.
9012 9012 Sometimes you have to take trains out of service for regular maintenance that 's planned, but the number of issues that we 've seen and the technical issues with these trains is not something that we should expect,.
9014 9014 This important analysis from MIT election researchers is the latest to show that the OAS 's statements were without basis, and that simple arithmetic shows that there is no evidence that fraud or irregularities affected the preliminary results, or the official results -- the ones that actually matter. The OAS needs to explain why it made these statements and why anyone should trust it when it comes to elections.
9023 9023 We continue to print and publish our books in all the ways we can and I 'm hugely grateful to our printers, our distributors and our publishing teams for their fortitude and commitment. We will continue to communicate as conditions change. We are grateful to all our stakeholders for their great and continuing support.
9026 9026 With these new routes, our operations will expand to 177 destinations around the world, reinforcing our position as one of the world 's most connected airlines. This ensures we can continue to provide our passengers with more options and flexibility when planning their business and leisure travel.
9032 9032 When it faces big challenges it does big things and lifting a $ 22 trillion economy off the mat again is really a herculean task, but I think we can be confident that America 's private sector, the best minds in government, good will, a bipartisan effort will get us there.
9033 9033 Fiscal policy in Europe now needs to step up urgently. The ECB can not prevent insolvencies, only governments can,.
9034 9034 It 's a sign of our humanity. If we ignored such events, we would have a hard time looking at ourselves in the mirror.
9035 9035 The Fed can always engage in purchases of assets during the next downturn,.
9037 9037 I am socially isolating because I lost my regular shifts at my ongoing job. I have a car, I do n't have dependants, I have a fully stocked fridge. I am good to go in terms of helping. It seemed something I morally should do.
9041 9041 All in all, the sparkle in China 's new economy seems to be dimming measured by the stagnant relative size and the worsening corporate financial health. Although leverage is not a problem ( much lower than old sectors ), lower revenue and return on capital are weighing down the financial health. Together with the broader picture of slower consumption and household income, this raises the question [ about ] China 's ability to solely rely on new sectors in the grand economic transition.
9046 9046 Nobody wants to cut spending, or raise taxes. But if you look at the data that the Congressional Budget Office put out, we need very significant changes.
9051 9051 How will governments react to global economic challenges in the new year ? What policy shifts can be made within the U.S., and internationally, to account for low growth trends ?.
9053 9053 Personally, I would prefer to see less magnitudes in the swings, as this would be more constructive in helping develop a base, if indeed we are forming one.
9055 9055 Our job now is to look for ways to expand banks' balance sheet, to create a mortgage market that would allow us to increase demand-side funding for housing,.
9057 9057 The service sector is really broad. It 's not just about serving coffee or taking care of children.
9059 9059 Given the state of the financial vulnerabilities in Canada, we judged the risk of reigniting the acceleration of house price expectations and the buildup of debt was too high - and that could make attaining our inflation target harder in the long run,.
9061 9061 Since we could n't devalue, we lost competitiveness.
9064 9064 In the field of engineering plastics, we have consistently followed a strategy of extending the product chain and ensuring the highest quality at every stage : from caprolactam ... converted to PA6 [ sic ] in the full viscosity range ... to various advanced modified materials with the addition of glass or carbon fibers,.
9067 9067 For a year, you can run a budget deficit of $ 2 trillion to $ 3 trillion dollars,.
9071 9071 For those interested in finding out more about the 5G coverage rollout and about the 5G handsets and devices available to take advantage of this new network technology, further detail can be found at telstra.com. au/5g or by talking to a team member in any Telstra store.
9075 9075 Since that projection was made, the COVID-19 virus -- a global health emergency -- has disrupted economic activity in China and could put the recovery at risk,.
9076 9076 This emergency financing will allow the government to address additional and urgent balance of payments needs and support policies that would make it possible to direct funds swiftly to Pakistan 's most affected sectors, including social protection, daily wage earners, and the healthcare system,.
9079 9079 We need to think of the challenges we will face on the other side of this crisis,.
9081 9081 We are already looking at adverse scenarios ... in which the impact on growth for China is more significant .... The Chinese authorities themselves are recognizing that there would be lower growth this year.
9089 9089 We are in the early stage of engagement, but I can assure you that we will attack very quickly as requests come,.
9090 9090 but only if we succeed with containing the virus everywhere and prevent liquidity problems from becoming a solvency issue.
9093 9093 We are going to experience a sharp collapse in output for one month. We have to spend 2 per cent on medical side which is slightly underestimated ... For one month output loss even if we make up one-third of output loss by social cushioning or propping up financial system, still it would be 3 per cent of GDP. So the number we came up with Rs 10 lakh crore ( Centre and states combined ) or 5 per cent of the GDP,.
9096 9096 There are hundreds of thousands of renters who want to purchase. But they do n't understand what 's involved or how to accomplish this goal. CreditSmart offers an efficient way for consumers to begin this journey.
9097 9097 In 2020, more home-building activity and consequent growth in supply should tame down home price gains,.
9099 9099 home prices should still be able to squeak out gains.
9109 9109 so that our antibodies to the virus can be harvested for therapeutic use,.
9110 9110 The danger is that the recovery is too slow and then too many people stay unemployed. So, we need to accelerate as much as we can.
9114 9114 Imagine if one U.S. government agency controlled General Electric, General Motors, Ford, Boeing, U.S. Steel, DuPont, AT & T, Verizon, Honeywell, and United Technologies. Furthermore, imagine this agency were not simply a passive shareholder, but ... could hire and fire management, deploy and transfer resources across holding companies, and generate synergies across its holdings.
9123 9123 For those Indian Muslims living in India as Indian citizens, there is no power that Parliament can exercise to remove their citizenship ... they are not under threat.
9126 9126 There may be some defence agreements. That will also boost his country. Above all, we are paying for the defence equipments and he is not giving it for free,.
9131 9131 perhaps its greatest emergency since independence.
9134 9134 Economically speaking, India is faced today with perhaps its greatest emergency since Independence. The global financial crisis in 2008-09 was a massive demand shock, but our workers could still go to work, our firms were coming off years of strong growth, our financial system was largely sound, and our government finances were healthy. None of this is true today as we fight the coronavirus pandemic,.
9139 9139 This could include longer-term layoffs, for example. At this point, we simply do not know.
9140 9140 The sudden halt in global activity will be followed by regional recoveries at different times, depending on the duration and severity of the outbreak in each region. This means that the global economic recovery, when it comes, could be protracted and uneven. The Canadian economy was in a solid position ahead of the COVID-19 outbreak, but has since been hit by widespread shutdowns and lower oil prices,.
9144 9144 Do we have a case here of yes, minister, in which these private providers can be relied upon to tell Cabinet what they want to hear ?.
9145 9145 e-mail should become pervasive. So should Internet/Web access. E-mail is the killer application of the Internet today, and browsing through information services the killer app of tomorrow.
9151 9151 One of the things I think has been done well is one person who has stature within the administration needs to be named to lead the effort, and the president wisely named his vice president,.
9152 9152 It 's just been reported that our planet experienced its second-hottest year on record in 2019. The last decade was the hottest decade in the history of our planet. Australia is on fire, the Arctic is melting and our seas are rising. If we were only measuring the new NAFTA by what it does to address climate change, it does n't work. Plain and simple.
9164 9164 would mean envying or resenting themselves, as they will be in later years.
9168 9168 Some have argued that we should fully reopen the economy now, as the coronavirus kills mostly the old and immune-compromised, and a relatively small percentage of those infected,.
9171 9171 Accordingly, securing tariff-free access to the UK market is a great prize, whereas allowing EU consumers to benefit from British-produced goods and services is a concession that may need to be made but is best avoided.
9174 9174 We can not deny that there is a general loss of trust and confidence of people,.
9178 9178 Gold bullion went negative for the year as of Friday, as investors liquidated their holdings to ride out the volatility. And although they have n't sold off as deeply as the rest of the market, gold mining stocks look cheap now, meaning it may be time to consider adding to your exposure,.
9180 9180 I do n't think a lot of people have been through a recession,.
9181 9181 It would be too slow and dispersed to substantially stimulate the economy, as households would receive only a modest benefit every pay period,.
9183 9183 If you did too little on health today, you would have to do much more down the line, and that will hurt the economy even more,.
9187 9187 We will only reduce our presence if we see the Taliban is really willing and able to deliver,.
9191 9191 fully supports the U.S.-led peace efforts, which can pave the way for intra-Afghan talks.
9193 9193 A new conflict would be in no one 's interest.
9195 9195 This is a US decision, it is not a decision taken by either the global coalition nor Nato, but all allies are concerned about Iran 's destabilizing activities in the region, Iran 's support to different terrorist groups,.
9197 9197 Our estimate : The average American would be willing to pay between US $ 2.60 and $ 4.60 to avoid an additional very hot day ( over 80 ° F ) in the past month in order to maintain [ their ] current mental health status.
9200 9200 The pandemic and the lockdowns to contain it are delivering a shock to the real economy on a scale that seems unprecedented in peacetime. Because of the unknown trajectory of the virus, with case numbers surging and lockdowns being tightened, it may be more difficult than during a financial crisis to deliver a policy announcement so stunning that it would restore market confidence and put an end to the equity bear market,.
9201 9201 Visible solidarity could strengthen the European project, a perceived lack of such solidarity could undermine the political foundations of the project instead.
9204 9204 It seems to me that many women take charge of their lives in every way except dating and marriage,.
9207 9207 Together, we chose the weekend when we would get engaged -- and then he took it from there,.
9212 9212 The slowdown in growth in China can have major impacts across Asia and the rest of the world, given the scale of the Chinese economy and its role as a major driver of global growth in recent years,.
9213 9213 Economic indicators will likely show significant improvement in the second quarter and the Chinese economy will return to its potential output level rather swiftly,.
9214 9214 I have no detailed information. As per newspaper reports, I have not yet found any strong reason why she should be deported from the country,.
9216 9216 Divisions between groups and sects not only damage our social lives, but they can also work as barriers to intellectual progress within and across the nations,.
9217 9217 For any kind of protest, opposition unity is important. Then protests become easier. Unity is important if the protest is for a proper cause,.
9225 9225 We would continue our vigil for a week for now. We would decide our next course of action later,.
9226 9226 Some people are describing this as a victory for Narendra Modi and Amit Shah but that is not right. Do not lose hope. We would fight both in court and on the streets,.
9227 9227 A fundamental departure from ( current ECB ) policy does not seem appropriate.
9228 9228 I am delighted with the quantity and quality of entries this year and I can not wait to see the looks on the faces of our worthy winners. This competition really is about saluting the best in Scotland and beyond and we will certainly see the best products recognized when the winners are announced.
9233 9233 A couple more days like yesterday in the stock market could do it. It looks pretty ugly. I 'm sure that 's really starting to spook people. It ` ll be hard to discern what eventually causes people to run for the bunker,.
9234 9234 People 's savings are depleted, their net worth is lower, there will be business failures. You would think that would be a problem for the president.
9236 9236 The economy 's long-term growth would likely be somewhat diminished by these policies,.
9238 9238 I think that 's what the show is,.
9243 9243 So, the total global profits of a multinational should be calculated, and then apportioned across countries according to some formula based on sales, employment and users ( for digital companies ). This is something that is already used in the US where state governments have the power to set direct and indirect tax rates.
9250 9250 Instead of having an event in Melbourne, take it to a bushfire-affected community or one on the edge of that fire zone now or in the next six months.
9251 9251 How long, it remains to be seen. I think we enjoy it while we can.
9253 9253 I 'm saying to companies, do not worry about whether these towns have a conference centre, do not worry about your normal meeting facilities,.
9258 9258 It is enjoying unprecedented momentum around the world and could finally be set on a path to fulfill its longstanding potential as a clean energy solution.
9259 9259 This is a huge opportunity we can not miss,.
9261 9261 The case for adding the new tools to the standard central bank toolkit thus seems clear.
9262 9262 a moderate increase in the inflation target or significantly greater reliance on active fiscal policy for economic stabilization, might become necessary,.
9263 9263 Overall, it could be a very bad year for the economy,.
9264 9264 The package can not be strong nor too weak. It has to be moderate and affordable. The government can not be expected to provide much more because of the continuing budget constraints and the lack of sufficient high savings of our reserves to meet, the uncertainties and hazards of rainy days and storms ahead, like we now face,.
9265 9265 The plethora of irregularities included use of duplicate tally sheets ; use of ` tippexed' and altered tally sheets ; use of fake or insecure tally sheets ; failure to account for null and void votes ; premature announcement of results without attending to complaints and gathering all results ; tampering during recording, counting and transmission of results ; and unlawful delegation by the Commissioners of their solemn constitutional duties,.
9276 9276 Yes, it might be the case that there are more accidents the week after spring forward, but if we did n't do it in the winter we would get an overall higher accident rate throughout the winter, statistically we would.
9280 9280 would see the Democratic Party as the party of gay rights, the party of abortion, and the party of big government,.
9281 9281 I think every major RIA should at least commit to protecting employees' job and pay for six months or a year.
9284 9284 There 's a big scary virus out there and people may not want to engage in economic activity in the way that they normally would,.
9292 9292 would require substantial emissions reductions over the next few decades and near zero emissions of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases by the end of the century.
9300 9300 The Fed must take proactive steps to ensure that the U.S. can compete successfully,.
9301 9301 I would like to see a conscience vote in the parliament. It 's about time we flushed out all the senators and members, and find out where they really stand on this issue. The current government is more interested in holding up lumps of coal in parliament than solving problems.
9306 9306 Certainly, this should take place on account of the Digital Economy National Project, proactive introduction of domestic developments and domestic software,.
9307 9307 Supply chains tend to adapt quite well to that kind of collective or irrational behaviour,.
9310 9310 There could be other explanations in the investor climate, but this to us is a hopeful sign.
9325 9325 People will ask, ` Why are you doing business with Delta ?' I will shake hands with anyone and do business with anyone if it is in the interests of my airline and my company.
9331 9331 The most important issue is the security of all troops inside Idlib. The government must take all necessary diplomatic and military measures for the safety of our soldiers,.
9334 9334 We usually think about giving people information -- that if we give people information, they would make the right decision,.
9335 9335 Is the easy behavior and the right behavior aligned ? If they are not, there is extra friction. And then how do we add motivation ?.
9336 9336 So, if you want to do good in the world, and you 're looking at these huge, massive problems, find something and scale the problem, find something that you can do that will have an impact, and then have that impact.
9337 9337 One of the mysteries to me remains why -- well, I can imagine why politically -- we created another problem for ourselves by saying there is only going to be limited number of employers who are involved in this, and there 's going to have to be a completely separate system for small businesses.
9343 9343 If the economy stays the way it is, Trump is going to win again.
9345 9345 going to happen at an accelerated rate, you can bet on it.
9346 9346 Instead, consistent with the more benign aspects of our history, it may signal a different form of openness.
9347 9347 The government needs to get to grips with social care urgently. It must fund care properly, with increased wages and training to make care an attractive career for UK residents and migrant workers alike.
9348 9348 It may be that the economy is picking up a little bit on the basis of slightly improved confidence,.
9349 9349 Rising interest costs associated with the debt would increase interest payments to foreign debt holders and thus reduce the income of U.S. households by increasing amounts,.
9350 9350 changes must be made to address the budget situation because our debt is growing on an unsustainable path,.
9351 9351 But our projections also suggest that over the long term, changes in fiscal policy must be made to address the budget situation, because our debt is growing on an unsustainable path.
9357 9357 It costs far more to have someone go to the ER for an intake evaluation than it does to see me for a whole year, and if we can make access to someone like me easier, we will save a lot of money,.
9358 9358 So we actually looked at the lives of people, patients who are seeking behavioral health services, and we compared how the decisions were made for those patients. And we found some things that were probably less than satisfactory,.
9359 9359 It would be inappropriate for me to do so. It would be wrong for me to do so.
9362 9362 Public Health Agency staff are working swiftly to identify contacts the individual may have had, with the objective of preventing further spread of the virus.
9363 9363 We have robust infection control measures in place which enable us to respond immediately. Our health service is used to managing infections and would assure the public that we are prepared.
9367 9367 The courage to stick with your beliefs, your convictions, the courage to speak about them publicly even when they are not popular, and the courage to act on them even if they will cause economic pain in the short-run if you are convinced that they are the right policies for the longer-run. I think Otmar Issing has demonstrated that kind of courage, as did Paul Volcker in the most difficult period for US monetary policy during my lifetime.
9368 9368 There 's no question the acquisition could and should face scrutiny,.
9371 9371 There may be some smaller banks that have to be bailed out, but I do n't think any of the big ones,.
9372 9372 You can exit and look the other way and Africa will be there,.
9377 9377 No, we 're not that far, and we 're just gon na assess it in the next week or so,.
9378 9378 I think my continual concern in this is that people are doing amazing work and stepping up to volunteer their time, and in volunteering our time, I 'm worried our labor is devalued and we 're being overworked.
9379 9379 In general, the benefits of breastfeeding at all are smaller than many people claim. But beyond this there is simply no evidence that using some formula in addition to breastmilk is problematic. And, indeed, supplementation can actually improve breastfeeding success if it makes it easier to continue,.
9380 9380 if the medical system is overwhelmed, this will be among the worst things to need.
9381 9381 It looks like something that 's naturally occurring. You can get it in great apes,.
9384 9384 In those circumstances, the Board would see a stronger case for further monetary easing.
9387 9387 There is a concern that we could be getting close to a crossover point where what has been a good thing may not be such a good thing in the future. There is no precise point for that crossover, we are just trying to judge it carefully both here and overseas.
9388 9388 The scenario on which we would be reducing interest rates is one where we are not making progress towards full employment and the inflation target,.
9392 9392 a rapid pace of acquisitions, and integration from a cultural, technological, and operational view can be a challenge.
9394 9394 Simple calculation says it would be over 80 per cent.
9397 9397 The first thing I did was to take the text across to the PM 's suite because I wanted him to hear about it first from me. He read it in silence and, at first, made no comment. Then, he suddenly asked me whether I thought he should resign,.
9399 9399 By being forced into doing it, it has the unintended merit of showing companies that they can in fact do remote work. If these companies increase, it could be a useful strategy during disasters.
9402 9402 the ACCC is continuing to consider whether further action is needed to make sure consumers are n't worse off when they switch to the NBN.
9403 9403 We do n't know how long coronavirus is going to be mucking around the economy, but let 's assume it 's six months and we are hoping things will be back to normal pretty quickly ... it would be a shame to make a decision on the basis that this next six months ... is the full world,.
9404 9404 Australia 's four major airports have collectively increased their aeronautical profit almost every year over the 17-year lifespan of the ACCC 's monitoring. This may illustrate the benefit of power of being a monopoly.
9405 9405 We want to check if prices are going up a bit that it 's really the farmers who are benefiting,.
9408 9408 The advantage of leasing, especially if rates are low as they are now, is that you can keep your money liquid,.
9413 9413 I apologised. I was the first minister. She was in my bedroom. We were tipsy, it should n't have happened.
9415 9415 Each enterprising city shall carry theme on enterprise setting up. It would be unique exposure for being a Swavalambi. A school beyond four walls,.
9417 9417 If you do n't take the risk, we 're going to be screwed,.
9418 9418 Japan 's experience can happen in other countries,.
9419 9419 unlike the rest of the world, Russia may be facing the most serious challenge since the collapse of the Soviet Union,.
9421 9421 whether the impacts are different on low-income customers, which is one of the biggest objections to advanced rates.
9422 9422 I think it 's time to be over it, especially now that they have gotten reauthorized.
9427 9427 That would be an important way of helping to reduce some of the pressure in holding those patients in a hospital environment pending the outcome of that test.
9429 9429 Four or five years after the crisis, the economy would have recovered much more because there 's less of a hole to climb out of.
9430 9430 If it is to generate ideas to help society achieve inclusive prosperity [ and so not push outsiders into the arms of populist politicians with no real answers to the problems being reacted against ] it will have to start by becoming more inclusive itself.
9431 9431 It 's a topic that 's of serious interest to all of us living in New Zealand or in Asia Pacific,.
9436 9436 Our medical workers are on the frontlines of this crisis, have been hit hardest by it and need all the help and support we can give them. We have rough days ahead, but with collective action like this, together we will make it through,.
9440 9440 There 's still a lot of skepticism in the U.S. ( about negative rates ) and I think they would utilize the other tools first. That said, several years down the road that debate could also have evolved, depending a little bit on what we see in places like Europe and what the, ultimately, post-mortem verdict is on the effectiveness of that tool,.
9447 9447 Once the virus is contained, then the economy should recover,.
9450 9450 But [ US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer ] also has crafted a deal that should deliver on his boss 's top priority : reducing the bilateral trade deficit.
9451 9451 Part of the reason for the increase is, I am sure, because of Universal Credit under the Tory Government 's welfare changes. Constituents have to wait a minimum of five weeks before receiving their first payment and I have dealt with cases where constituents have been evicted from their homes because of this disastrous scheme. The Tories should think again.
9455 9455 And also this expansion, which I think of by the way just the 13th inning of the Obama economic expansion. It is n't going to go on forever.
9456 9456 If you are trying to get to 3 per cent in an economy in its 11th year of recovery that 's a tough task,.
9457 9457 In the regional election in Emilia-Romagna, the Five Star Movement came only fourth. It will now be very hard to discipline its MPs in Rome. This is the real threat to the stability for the national government : can the Five Stars bear the blow ?.
9458 9458 That 's because Boeing kept producing the 737 Max throughout last year despite the grounding of the 737 Max. That 's not the case anymore. Sadly, tens of thousands of people are probably going to be laid off before this crisis is done,.
9462 9462 Until a vaccine is available, nobody is going out to work, play or go to school. The economy, national, regional and global we knew is dead, it.
9466 9466 The market still has the ultimate ballast, or anchor, which is the U.S. economy,.
9467 9467 Over the last 12 months between our Gympie and Tin Can Bay offices we 've averaged about a contract a day, around 30 a month,.
9475 9475 My advice, is do not call anyone in the profession who is an adult by a child, and particularly do not call anyone who is an African American a boy or a girl.
9476 9476 The economy is strong. It can stand on its own feet and it can grow pretty consistently. And so we should let it do that,.
9479 9479 if you want to start a grocery store that sells milk products in an inner-city neighborhood, you have 15 permits to get through. There would be much to like about having one person whose job it is to get them through the permitting process.
9480 9480 I think it 's not too surprising that Treasury is playing a prominent role,.
9488 9488 a systematic reevaluation of allowing access to private health insurance for basic services seems appropriate, especially in light of theory and evidence that argues, on balance, that doing so would have net social benefits.
9492 9492 Racist behaviors or stereotyping in or outside of the classroom are not acceptable at UW -- Madison,.
9494 9494 I 'm suggesting that we are even probably close to 15 percent right now.
9495 9495 people would n't even have to give up flying, or petrol cars, if everyone gave up meat and dairy.
9499 9499 We are optimistic that this would reduce the number of patients that move to mechanical ventilation.
9504 9504 These appointments demonstrate our commitment to nurturing talent and rewarding success. We have a deep pool of highly qualified and dedicated employees, who can be challenged with more responsibility in attaining our corporate vision. We remain committed to diversity and inclusion ; are delighted by the depth and quality of experience that this leadership team brings to our group. These appointments further indicate our internal succession capacity and strong corporate governance practices,.
9505 9505 Unless something really traumatic happens, it 's actually not that great, but obviously, if Iran, you know, does something to block oil shipments from the Middle East, that would have a striking effect if the U.S. were suddenly to be thrown into a war,.
9507 9507 If our estimate of inflation and the economic situation require, the key rate may be set beneath the lower bound of the neutral range. This will mean ( a ) loose monetary policy.
9512 9512 Some of the specifics of the proposals that are in the governor 's package need to be thought through, make sure they 're evidence-based and that they 'll have a real impact,.
9516 9516 This is a moment when the banks, in a way, can redeem themselves,.
9517 9517 They must have a positive intention and support the club on its way to the top, on its way to being profitable and successful.
9520 9520 And I love who I work with, I love who I work for, that newsroom is a great place. I just love those people. And while it was really an intriguing concept to be at this new station, and the Chicago Cubs, and all of that, I just could n't imagine not working there. And that 's why I turned it down.
9523 9523 The true infection fatality rates could therefore differ from our estimates. For instance, it is possible that countries with very good health systems are more successful in treating patients than China.
9524 9524 Case fatality rates may only be a very poor proxy for the true infection fatality rate if a high number of infections remain undetected,.
9525 9525 This is going to be like the war production board in a way from World War II, but we can be pretty confident that along with the right business leaders this should work out pretty well,.
9526 9526 This thinking does n't fully reflect people 's complex relationship with information. We wanted to create a way to measure an individual 's tendency to pursue or shy away from information.
9527 9527 We 're delighted to be chosen to highlight our brand at Tesco head office. Our long-standing relationship with them means that as we launch new products we can continue to reach a wide audience quickly and effectively.
9528 9528 You 're getting electricity production [ from solar panels ] with almost no carbon emissions or no any emissions of any sort, which is an advantage over burning coal or burning natural gas to generate electricity,.
9529 9529 If you use existing institutions ... the EIB could do it immediately. The ESM is there. They can all issue mutualised European debt,.
9536 9536 If you watch the press conference, whatever he 's talking about apparently really bothered him because it had nothing to do with the topic he was previously discussing. But I have no idea what it was !.
9542 9542 This is a crisis where people who believe in sides can easily gain.
9543 9543 Confidence matters in volatile times. It would have been better for the Fed to cut by 25 [ basis points ] and let markets hope for more,.
9549 9549 And if people ca n't handle that ? F * * * 'em. I 'm just a person in a band.
9556 9556 It 's time we stopped blaming Brexit for all this, or using Brexit as an excuse.
9560 9560 Because if we keep the currency stable then we will make sure that the pricing process among the retailers is delinked from volatility and we have less of USD pricing,.
9565 9565 It is a story about grand good and grand evil, but very slowly the colors begin to desaturate, and it becomes this story that lives not in black and white, but in the grey and that murky morality. If we hunt these monsters, do we risk becoming them ourselves ? This story is really about the cost of what happens to our heroes when they do take up that mantle and hold that dagger and go after these Nazis. Do they sacrifice their souls to make the world a better place, to rid evil from the world ?.
9570 9570 If this gets worse than we currently expect, we 're going to commit to make up to any short term inflation shortfalls.
9571 9571 It 's not going to happen by magic or encouraging everyone not to pollute the air.
9572 9572 Perhaps India 's Greatest Challenge in Recent Times.
9575 9575 We think of defensive medicine as playing a negative role, but it can also play a positive role.
9576 9576 The uncertainty that it is creating is also likely to affect domestic spending. As a result, GDP growth in the March quarter is likely to be noticeably weaker than earlier expected.
9579 9579 As we deal with it as best we can, we also need to look to the other side when things will recover,.
9580 9580 Higher asset prices and a willingness to take on more risk can be good for the global economy, especially if they lead to more investment, not just more borrowing.
9589 9589 given the backward-looking nature of W & I cover, and the ability to disclose against known issues, we would not expect to see coronavirus exclusions become a common feature of W & I polices, but coronavirus concerns may creep in on transactions where there is a particular exposure to the risk coupled with warranties which have been poorly disclosed against.
9590 9590 Negative rates may have had some positive effects on financial and property markets. But the side-effects, such as the hit to banks' earnings, have also been big,.
9595 9595 There needs to be bottom-up analysis of the impact so we can then agree on synchronized, or even better, coordinated measures to protect the world economy from a more serious shock.
9597 9597 The reality is global growth remains sluggish. A co-ordinated fiscal response can boost growth,.
9602 9602 It would also keep us bound by EU legislation, at a point when we need legislative and economic flexibility to manage the UK response to the Coronavirus pandemic.
9604 9604 Fiscal policy should be flexible and growth-friendly while ensuring debt as a share of GDP is on a sustainable path,.
9607 9607 Our message is spend as much as you can but keep the receipts. We do n't want accountability and transparency to take a back seat in this crisis.
9613 9613 We also remind consumers that many small and medium business are trying to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak as best they can. We urge consumers to exercise patience and treat service staff with courtesy and respect as they fulfil consumer requests for refunds and remedies.
9614 9614 These Takata NADI 5-AT airbags may kill or injure vehicle occupants if they misdeploy in an accident,.
9616 9616 Retailers are increasing plan allowances or reducing excess charges to help their customers adjust, and they should be applauded for this.
9617 9617 Individual banks can still offer more favourable and tailored terms to business customers outside of this proposed agreement.
9619 9619 He must use it to tackle the many serious economic challenges that are emerging, and not allow divisive issues to occupy centre-stage,.
9620 9620 The voice of the youth is unlikely to be silenced easily. In any society, students and the youth are the ones most likely to speak the truth if only because they have the least to lose and the most to gain,.
9622 9622 If the world is on fire it seems to me voters are going to be pretty happy to hear that someone has an ambitious plan to rescue us from this inevitable fate,.
9623 9623 It 's not a good time to be drawing upon it. These are savings that should be preserved for retirement,.
9625 9625 To identify the largest opportunities and to manage the associated risks, disclosures of climate risk must become comprehensive, climate risk management must be transformed, and investing for a net-zero world must go mainstream.
9631 9631 the possibility that uncertainties over future trading relationships could remain entrenched.
9632 9632 Well, that has n't been the case, but they could make that argument,.
9639 9639 We would have known it was coming,.
9640 9640 This year was good news. We could have a lot more good news.
9648 9648 It appears from state numbers that the order of magnitude increase compared to normal is about 10,.
9661 9661 [ The coronavirus ] will need to break through the job market firewall if it is to do significant damage to the economy,.
9664 9664 Without President Bush' s decision to support some tax increases along with spending cuts in the 1990 legislation, the economic boom of the 1990s would have been significantly diminished,.
9665 9665 I think large companies are going to be slower to lay off. They are going to try to get through this,.
9666 9666 I think it 's going to do damage. It 's going to change the trajectory of the U.S. and global economy in the first quarter and probably for the year as a whole.
9671 9671 Students are asked not to return to campus after Spring Recess and to meet academic requirements remotely until further notice. Students who need to remain on campus will also receive instruction remotely and must prepare for severely limited on-campus activities and interactions. All graduate students will transition to remote work wherever possible. Schools will communicate more specific guidance and information, and we encourage everyone to review previous guidance about both international and domestic travel.
9672 9672 What was once a strong commitment to academic exchange is being eroded by a visa and immigration process that often treats international students and international scholars with scrutiny and suspicion, if not outright disdain and distrust,.
9673 9673 To get the [ average ] price of electricity down to € 0.02 or € 0.03 per kWh is going to be an enormous, enormous challenge,.
9680 9680 Africa may lose half of its GDP with growth falling from 3.2 per cent to about 2 per cent due to a number of reasons. They include the disruption of global supply chains,.
9681 9681 At a time where leaders seem to be more about self than society, Shackleton sacrificed his own needs to ensure the wellbeing of his team -- that 's inspirational.
9682 9682 Rather than spending so much effort worrying about what China is taking from us, we should be thinking about what we can get from China.
9684 9684 They may never do that, but you do n't build extra capacity without the idea that you might use it.
9687 9687 As somebody who has been associated with the power sector for almost three decades, including as minister, the call to go dark for 9 min at 9 pm on April 5 can have deep impact on the grid and its stability. I sincerely hope this is being properly managed.
9688 9688 Lastly, I was struck by the dignity of his tone throughout this speech. At no point does he display rancour or a sense of injury. He does n't even defend himself-except on the absurd claim about soldiers not having clothes and shoes.
9690 9690 The BJP wants to exclude certain communities from the CAA ... BJP 's policy is one of excluding Muslims. We want to include everybody. Tamils from Sri Lanka, Christians from Bhutan, Ahamedias from Pakistan ... Citizenship should not be based on religion. That is our fundamental position because that was rejected by our Constitution makers and it violates Article 14 of our Constitution,.
9695 9695 But as long as Russia does not respect existing agreements, like the INF agreement, then of course there is no way that we can maintain that treaty.
9697 9697 So I welcome the dialogue between Turkey and the European Union, and I trust that the way forward can be found. NATO will continue to play its part. We are currently deployed in the GNC to help tackle the refugee and migrant crisis. Allies are also prepared to continue to support Turkey, and we are exploring what more we may be able to do,.
9700 9700 So, the focus of NATO now is on how can we reinforce any part of the alliance, if needed, in the east or the south or the west or north or wherever it 's needed ?.
9701 9701 I think they are going to do a lot to ease people 's fears, ease people 's anxieties.
9703 9703 I think we were quite clear about managing the macro and fiscals in the past three years and as well very conservative as what we are planning to do in 2020. Therefore, we do n't think there is a challenge at all, in terms of the timing and government 's commitment to fiscal prudence and discipline.
9704 9704 This is to encourage the diaspora to see themselves as Ghanaians when conducting business in Ghana or buying a land,.
9706 9706 Or it could develop into something broader -- and that 's the kind of calculus you have to do when you 're thinking about monetary policy.
9707 9707 the supply shock could evolve into a demand shock,.
9708 9708 Some people ... say : ` I am willing to take the risk of a very low-interest rate now,' and others say the problem with that is, if you do end up with a financial stability problem, the very people you are trying to help are going to be the ones that are hurt worse ... That is kind of the issue. It may be about a time-frame question.
9711 9711 Transgender youth are at especially high risk and face unique types of discrimination and trauma while experiencing homelessness. Young people should never have to fear discrimination or violence in seeking services, and we must not fail them by rolling back the very policies meant to protect them.
9714 9714 But basically the system is set up so that no matter what medical treatment can be created, they pretty much all get to be paid for.
9716 9716 Of course I do ... There 's no way that I could do anything else.
9718 9718 Our three-year-old daughter wants to know if her daddy is coming back. She wants to know when he is coming home,.
9725 9725 She votes against the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which is just basically protecting us from domestic abuse and stalking. She thinks if you 're a gay couple or even look like a gay couple, you should be allowed to be kicked out of a restaurant. It 's really basic human rights and it 's right and wrong at this point, and I ca n't see another commercial and see her disguising these policies behind the words Tennessee Christian values. Those are n't Tennessee Christian values. I live in Tennessee. I am Christian. That 's not what we stand for.
9726 9726 If AI is a black box, then people wo n't trust it. In a connected world, however, the trust will be essential,.
9727 9727 if you have a new medication to try to cure cancer, and you run a clinical trial on it and it does n't work, you do n't just say, ` I guess that 's it, we 're stuck with cancer.' You keep trying other things .... We 're not going to give up on improving the efficiency of health care delivery and the well-being of this incredibly under-served population. We need to continue to develop potential solutions and rigorously evaluate them.
9729 9729 I welcome Namo 's ( Narendra Modi ) statement in Kolkata that History, as we know, should be reviewed. He should implement that statement by re-naming Victoria Memorial as Rani Jhansi Smarak Mahal. Queen Victoria took over India after the betrayal of Rani Jhansi in 1857 and looted India for 90 years.
9730 9730 I will be forced to go to court. We can not sell our family silver,.
9731 9731 Today I am in court for completion of my cross examination in the NH case. May have to miss Parliament.
9733 9733 limited if any effectiveness,.
9734 9734 Some repo might be needed at least through April, when tax payments will sharply reduce reserve levels.
9736 9736 If this were resolved in say a one-or two-quarter slowdown in growth, that 's probably not something that changes the big picture, but I agree it 's a challenging situation, we 're going to keep on top of it.
9737 9737 The cave crickets who venture out of the caves at night to feed may also struggle to find food in the fire-ravaged landscape, so there will be broader ecological impacts on the caves precinct.
9738 9738 These would be dire performance figures for any December but what 's worrying is that we are still awaiting the truly cold winter weather that we know will plunge the NHS into further problems.
9739 9739 Unlike Barnier, BoJo is a bluffer, a populist as they say. You must n't take him at his word in what he says every day,.
9740 9740 We are very aware that we must be very careful to avoid moral hazard,.
9741 9741 underestimate the impact in terms of both confidence or psychology and the real impact on trade, on tourism,.
9747 9747 the impact of the virus on the economy and markets should also be softened by monetary and fiscal policy.
9749 9749 Higher borrowing costs will expose financial vulnerabilities that have accumulated during years of low interest rates, leading to a heightened risk that debt can not be rolled over,.
9753 9753 It does n't have a tax base it can lean heavily on. If it does n't get help from both the federal government and the state, I think it 's in pretty substantial trouble.
9754 9754 The attitude should be we 're at war with this pandemic, we 're going to win this war,.
9757 9757 People around the world will notice whether or not those commitments that the governments, companies [ have made ] are going to fade away or disappear when the market conditions change ... I think this is a really important issue for the credibility of the companies and the governments,.
9759 9759 We are not ruling out a further downward revision. There is no escaping a scenario [ coronavirus' impact ] -- however temporary -- that could result in the lowest oil demand growth in a decade,.
9767 9767 The rest is, more or less, a reiteration of China 's IMF and existing G-20 commitments.
9773 9773 One challenge would be to implement stimulus quickly, when it is likely to be most necessary.
9779 9779 I have looked at historical systems going back to the beginning of our country, because I think you can gain valuable insights by comparing economic performance under one set of monetary rules versus another. But money only moves forward.
9781 9781 It 's just the nature of having power that causes people in power to abuse the privilege. I think we 're now at a point where we have to ask if we can even trust government to regulate the value of our money.
9788 9788 That 's why we would not do that. We would say ` pay us a certain amount to be on the steering committee, be a member of a consortium of companies.' And then we know we 're preparing students for a variety of corporate pathways, not just one.
9792 9792 Comments accepted through this email address do not appear to have been publicly available to others during the comment period, and it is my understanding that they remain unavailable today,.
9794 9794 He 's reduced - the administration proposed reducing EPA funding by I think almost a third. Almost a third. But go ahead.
9799 9799 I look forward to working with Abellio as the new franchise operators throughout their franchise term, to see how we can further enhance the service with more trains and direct access to major cities in the north.
9800 9800 Should the G20 countries tomorrow impose a 25 per cent minimum tax on their multinationals, more than 90 per cent of the world 's profits would immediately become effectively taxed at 25 per cent or more.
9802 9802 We ´ ve heard loud and clear that financial support could enable them to keep the lights on and pay people who can ´ t come to work.
9803 9803 one of the hardest things anyone can go through.
9807 9807 At Facebook, we 're really focused not just on ourselves, but on the small businesses that use our platform, because this could be devastating.
9808 9808 Everyone in this crisis has a responsibility to do what they can do. We are really actively trying to get the right information to the right people.
9811 9811 It helps people articulate something that they 've been feeling but perhaps have n't been able to say and certainly not as succinctly and powerfully. So, it 's an important part of the political discourse.
9812 9812 They may be resistant, they may want to do the investigation on their own, but this has had a huge consequence for the world,.
9824 9824 The big question mark will be on whether the private sector can regather its momentum,.
9825 9825 Revenue administration measures are already bearing fruit, with an improved record on tax collection in the recent past. While rising public debt has been a key concern -- especially with the October 2019 raising of the debt ceiling to KSh9 trillion, from an earlier cap of 50 per cent of GDP -- a sustained and meaningful fiscal consolidation should boost confidence,.
9829 9829 I frankly do n't think there is a significant trade-off because with all banks being told to do this, the usual argument against forgoing dividends -- that if a bank does this it will signal it is in trouble -- does n't apply,.
9831 9831 I think a ` V' is possible, but I am worried that the outcome will be worse and it really depends to my mind on just how much damage is done during the time that the economy is shut down in the way it is now,.
9832 9832 Kerry 's fuzzy diplospeak made it clear that he was there only because he had to be, and that he could n't reconcile himself with what had to be done.
9838 9838 are they [ the couple ] supposed to use hot money to pay their solicitor ?.
9847 9847 are going back to the Hamptons, and older people who are scared of things like viruses are less likely to have that Fifth Avenue apartment.
9850 9850 There could be a point beyond which too much banking is not good for growth ... but in fact detracts from growth perhaps by sucking resources into the financial sector.
9851 9851 You have multiple guys that can score, you do n't necessarily have one guy that 's going to go off for forty and becomes the focus on the game plan.
9852 9852 But there are only several million people at or near the minimum wage,.
9853 9853 It could be an ICC-compliant court in Sudan or in the region.
9856 9856 After the pandemic has ended, the tax must be continued to fund social housing and the Green New Deal, and create thousands of jobs during what will be a deep recession.
9857 9857 to ensure the rest of the city can have food, shelter, clothing and other basic necessities.
9859 9859 If I can make a confession, I am hoping to win this one too,.
9863 9863 The coronavirus outbreak has been a gift to nativist nationalists and protectionists, and it is likely to have a long-term impact on the free movement of people and goods,.
9864 9864 The question has always been in other scenarios if you can detect these clones at earlier or in different contexts, and if they mean anything.
9865 9865 The slippery slope is that they buy things to help out favoured elements of the economy. That makes the central banks no different than a government making bailouts or strategic investments.
9867 9867 But it is very unlikely as it appears to us that the crisis will prolong for the next couple of months,.
9870 9870 I think it may be the first time in history that we are deliberately creating a recession, not because we want to do so, but because this health threat is so real.
9871 9871 It is probably true we have people who have those kinds of conditions who are thinking it is too risky to go to the emergency room, particularly when they are unsure of their health problem. And there are going to be negative health effects there that we are not measuring.
9874 9874 There was already reason to question whether markets were a bit too buoyant,.
9876 9876 This easy-to-follow, comprehensive program is indispensable for our business and our customers with audio, visual or mobility impairments.
9881 9881 If I was an investor, better safe rather than sorry. The paper markets are up 1 per cent today means nothing. This is a time to be defensive and go for cash and bonds rather than equity,.
9888 9888 You can go and live where you want, but was the company obliged to pay for the move ?.
9890 9890 Containment measures and fear of infection would hit production as well as spending hard and drive many of the epidemic affected countries into outright recession,.
9894 9894 If a bank 's clients go bankrupt that is not a case for central banks to intervene,.
9896 9896 The thing about virus economics that 's different from regular business-cycle economics is the most important thing you can do for the economy has nothing to do with the economy.
9897 9897 If people stay home from school, stop traveling and do n't go to sporting events, the gym or the dentist, the economic consequence would be worse.
9898 9898 We have trucks that would only do an average of 10,000 kms a year with 40,000 kms on them becuase they have been bees on them that many times.
9902 9902 one very good predictor that you 're frail is if you use a wheelchair or walker ; Medicare is concerned doctors will start giving people wheelchairs or walkers and they do n't want to encourage that.
9903 9903 The revolving door between EU authorities and lobby associations must be stopped. The EBA should veto the move from Farkas to the banking lobby at the last minute.
9905 9905 Too many descriptive words can hurt sellers.
9909 9909 You either regulate or price carbon -- or [ emissions ] wo n't go down.
9910 9910 show Iran that we own escalation : If they kill one of our men we can kill 30 of theirs,.
9911 9911 That really forced me to rethink a lot about what I believed in the world, what I thought was important,.
9914 9914 We do n't know what the reaction of Iran would be, but they say they will take revenge. The Middle East needs a climate where rationality and wisdom should prevail, not weapons,.
9915 9915 The emissions of fashion weeks might be as much as Saint Kitts and Nevis,.
9916 9916 Agencies should be encouraged to partner with outside companies and entities that are really good at this,.
9918 9918 If you are in a heavy traffic situation, you can set it up so that you do n't have to constantly be changing your speed control and stepping on the brake and starting all over again,.
9919 9919 We are glad that we can once again entrust Russia to organize a major international tournament,.
9921 9921 We have consistently expanded disclosure ( and ) the expansion today we think is the most relevant data,.
9924 9924 If the lockdown extends till the end of May, it could cost the country around 9 % of GDP,.
9930 9930 And on the employee side, it could have a macro-economic effect. You could even offset the 5 percent economic decline with the payroll tax cut. And we do n't have to have a recession if the virus fades and the third quarter booms.
9937 9937 reduce the number of priorities ... There are only so many things you can do.
9940 9940 this could be misused and weaponised.
9942 9942 If you 're willing to do some of the things that you said you would n't do in the past, though, in terms of Medicare ....
9943 9943 Managers and agents have said that normally they would see about 10 per cent of the streams, so the amplification is massive,.
9945 9945 But I do n't think it 's going to be enough,.
9946 9946 I repeat what I said in 2008 that we 'll do what is necessary or as they have said elsewhere, whatever it takes,.
9948 9948 You 're buying a house. They 're asking $ 1,000,000 for it. Your job needs to be to figure out whether that 's a good deal. One thing you might think to yourself is ` if I rented out that house -- net of my expenses -- how much would I be earning every year ?'.
9949 9949 I have fear for my family 's health and wellness. I do n't know, should I be wearing a mask on the subway ? Should I not travel ? You know, how is my life as I know it going to be interrupted ? That 's where my anxiety lies.
9950 9950 If you can get people to do it, it is a net win for carbon sequestration,.
9951 9951 It does n't mean Donald Trump is a better monetary economist -- and better policymaker than people on the board -- for arguing the Fed should lower interest rates, and low behold, it eventually had to. That 's just a coincidence,.
9958 9958 We are going to do it in sections, small sections so we can a half block, block or two blocks, or whatever we can afford at the time,.
9960 9960 Going into 2020, we remain constructive on gold as late-cycle concerns, heightened political uncertainty coupled with only a modest growth acceleration should, in our view, support investment demand for gold,.
9961 9961 It 's either you raise taxes, which is unfeasible in Italy since they are already extremely high, or you repay it through sustained economic growth which needs structural reforms to happen and these have n't been passed in 30 years.
9967 9967 Tragically, the Holocaust might have been a wake-up call. Anti-Semitism has existed for thousands of years and is once again on the rise, and I think the nations of the world have now said, ` We 're not going to see this happen again under our watch.
9974 9974 The purpose of education is not ranking. But ranking in international assessment is useful because we see ourselves to the mirror of global standard. We must face the challenges that confront education for the country, for the future, for our learners, and not to [ attain ] rank number one,.
9976 9976 It 's the government 's job to make sure that the employees are sufficiently protected at work, for example through face masks. And companies should pay their employees high enough bonuses to incite them to keep on working,.
9978 9978 Our findings strongly suggest that psilocybin therapy is a promising means of improving the emotional, psychological, and spiritual well-being of patients with life-threatening cancer,.
9979 9979 ` We believe the greater risk is that the impact of the coronavirus on earnings may well be underestimated in current stock prices, suggesting that the risks of a correction are high,.
9984 9984 if the University were to recognize the union, that process would stop, and be replaced by the highly regulated and legalistic process of collective bargaining.
9985 9985 That would work out to be about 1.7 % of GDP. But if this pandemic continues, we might have to do it again in a month.
9987 9987 it does n't take much data to swing it one way or the other.
9989 9989 I trust that GW would formulate plans to avoid that contingency.
9991 9991 I felt faint from exhaustion and intensive weeks. Now things are better again. I 'm going home now to rest tonight so I can get back to work tomorrow to fight the corona crisis as best I can,.
9993 9993 We can not at the moment put a number on the concrete economic effects of the coronavirus,.
9998 9998 The student community has a great many issues to think about. But the CAA in my judgment should really be turned down by the Supreme Court on the grounds of being unconstitutional. You can not have certain types of fundamental rights of human beings, in this case, connected with citizenship, be related with religious differences rather than the things that really matter such as where you were born, and what the citizenship laws require you to do,.
10001 10001 The fact is that if this drags on, then everything starts to unwind,.
10002 10002 You can do it quickly on the employer side and we need employers not to fire people,.
10004 10004 central bank can not be the only game in town.
10009 10009 For 2020 it is negative ꟷ a recession at least as bad as during the global financial crisis or worse.
10011 10011 In those cases, in countries like India and Kenya, cash transfers made with the help of unique identification systems and digital technologies, or in-kind provision of food and medicine, such as in Bangladesh, are possible options,.
10014 10014 There may be a sizeable rebound, but only if we succeed with containing the virus everywhere and prevent liquidity problems from becoming a solvency issue. A sudden stop of the world economy could create a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs.
10017 10017 We remain very concerned about the negative outlook for global growth in 2020 and in particular about the strain a downturn would have on emerging markets and low income countries,.
10018 10018 excessive inequality hinders growth and ... can fuel populism and political upheaval.
10022 10022 In our current baseline scenario, announced policies are implemented and China 's economy would return to normal in the second quarter,.
10023 10023 could put the recovery at risk.
10027 10027 It is now clear that we have entered a recession as bad or worse than in 2009,.
10028 10028 We are telling everybody ` do what you can.' I just want to assure you that we are following our own advice. Everything is on the table in terms of measures we can take,.
10029 10029 We 're in an early stage of engagement, but I can assure you that we will act very quickly as requests come.
10034 10034 I do n't think there 's a single new development building that has not come under pressure from banks,.
10035 10035 If you use food delivery apps, you wo n't get a bargain. You will pay more,.
10036 10036 It becomes a separate issue. It becomes a different problem. So I think we have to move but we ca n't move too quickly.
10038 10038 It 's hard to see the airlines staying afloat in financial terms, so I think we need to be considering at least temporary national ownership,.
10043 10043 give me optimism that policy changes are under way and will work if Ukraine can seize the moment.
10044 10044 The goal of the World Bank in this crisis has been to take broad, fast action, that makes it most effective if we can have a broad response that helps individual countries but that helps the group as a whole,.
10051 10051 At least one of the charges against me on the indictment, I think there was a legitimate grievance, even if it was n't what actually happened and not what was presented at the time,.
10055 10055 There will probably be some falling behind, but people are likely to catch up,.
10056 10056 Certainly, it seems that the potential downside risks have eased as the United States and China approach a deal. This all bears watching during the coming year,.
10057 10057 Back in 2013, I thought we 'd be ` home' long ago, but things kept happening to us,.
10060 10060 No one goes to the IMF happily, whether it be the previous governments or the current one. The situation compels us [ to do so ],.
10061 10061 How will this country be run, even if we earn 5 trillion with a 12pc tax-to-GDP ratio, then the federal government then has to give around 3 trillion to the provinces. So the federal government already starts at a deficit.
10071 10071 I think the U.S. is certain to have a recession, in fact, I think we 're already in it. Data lags by months so we wo n't know by June what the March economy will be like but you can, to some extent, see it with the behaviour of consumers.
10073 10073 In any event, total layoffs between the March and April payroll surveys look destined to reach perhaps 16 to 20 million, consistent with the unemployment rate leaping to 13 to 16 %. In one month.
10077 10077 If the current rate of growth were to be sustained, with cases doubling every three days, the U.S. will have four million cases in just over two week 's time,.
10080 10080 The question is how, not whether, they will respond. For markets, the key issue is the impact of the Iranian response on oil prices,.
10089 10089 If we do n't understand how this world is developing and what its rules are, if we insist our country is part of the old order, this new world will make us its victim.
10090 10090 Russia has wonderful solutions and its own platforms, it is very important in this sense to help our smart people who create these digital platforms, and to help with export, in general, to determine areas where we can push and where we can develop,.
10091 10091 There 's been significant restrictions on the movement of people and business within China and we 're still ascertaining the impacts, the potential impacts, on trade but I do n't think that 'll be clear for some time,.
10093 10093 A lot of analysis on polarization is focused on the U.S., so we thought it could be interesting to put the U.S. in context and see whether it is part of a global trend or whether it looks more exceptional,.
10094 10094 If I can earn 4 percent by holding reserves at the Fed, it 's not a good deal to lend it out to you at 4.5 percent, given that you 're a little risky.
10097 10097 Industry also reacted quite dramatically. A lot of banks closed offices, the cost of doing business in many countries started to rise because there was screening, there was rerouting of production chains. And you could actually see that in real time,.
10107 10107 We are only looking at small wordings of the contract ... we should just be finished and we 'll make sure that Rwanda becomes an important hub in Africa,.
10113 10113 every year was unto itself, often shaped by circumstances that could not be foreseen at the start of the year.
10114 10114 Neither of us knows how we contracted the virus, but the good news -- if there is any to be had -- is that far fewer people crossed our paths recently than is usually the case,.
10117 10117 do some of the things that you said you would n't do in the past.
10118 10118 Hydrofluoric acid is so dangerous that it could quickly hurt or kill tens of thousands of people or more if a release occurred in a densely populated area.
10120 10120 Filing taxes can be complicated and time-consuming, and many Delaware families might not know about the benefits they are entitled to claim. I encourage every Delawarean in need of assistance to seek out the free help that is available and avoid leaving money on the table this tax season.
10121 10121 Should this body vote to confirm Mr. Ray, his general approach of non-responsiveness to the committee 's vetting process sets a concerning precedent.
10122 10122 I would have preferred to see some of the downside risks manifest themselves before the actual cuts,.
10123 10123 The statement would convey whether the accumulated changes in these indicators have materially changed the Committee 's outlook,.
10126 10126 I would like to personally reiterate that these allegations are false and we remain committed to the highest governance standards, built on a strong foundation of ethics. We take our responsibilities as good corporate citizens extremely seriously. We find our strength in the unshaken trust reposed by our customers, shareholders, partners and employees,.
10130 10130 welcome any steps that can lead to a reduction in violence.
10133 10133 Some may seek to use the economic downturn as an opening to invest in our critical industries and infrastructure, which in turn may affect our long-term security and our ability to deal with the next crisis, when it comes,.
10139 10139 prepared to continue to support Turkey and we are exploring what more we may be able to do.
10140 10140 One is to continue with largely a US dollar based multi-currency system, number two we could consider joining the rand monetary area as an approach,.
10143 10143 There is always more activity in the economy than we think.
10145 10145 Other countries in the European Union have very similar problems, they say : first, we need to educate ; secondly, we must help those who have problems ; third, we need to help people who have loved ones who have gambling problems,.
10149 10149 The trick is that Russia, Saudi Arabia and the US would have to agree to it, and how they would divide it. The US government generally does n't control production-companies do,.
10150 10150 Observers will be quick to notice if governments' and companies' emphasis on the transition dies down when market conditions become more challenging.
10151 10151 Playing Russian roulette in oil markets may well have grave consequences,.
10154 10154 At the current price levels, which we think will be with us for at least a few years to come, LNG will penetrate the Asian markets,.
10157 10157 This political tourism of taking Ambassadors on a guided tour of J & K should be stopped. This is our demand in the context of J & K,.
10159 10159 Congress leaders have to reinvent themselves. Congress party has to reinvent itself if it has to be relevant,.
10162 10162 We understand that today industry has idle capacity. It can produce more. It is perfectly feasible to supply this increase in demand and we will use all the tools available so that speculative practices are penalized.
10163 10163 Fiscal conservatives and deficit hawks seem to have changed their tune, all in the name of massive tax cuts that would primarily benefit the wealthy.
10165 10165 I think the financial markets still sort of believe it will be back to normal by the end of the year or early next year. And if they 're right, that 's very different than the Great Depression, which lasted 10 years.
10170 10170 No matter what job title you have, whether that 's an athlete or you know somebody working in a school right now and there 's a lot of people that are going to be out of work, and in a tough spot and hopefully we can get them the help that they need.
10180 10180 Combining AFG and Connective would create the largest mortgage aggregator in Australia by a significant margin, accounting for almost 40 per cent of all mortgage brokers operating in Australia,.
10182 10182 they have got contracts in place internationally and you have to be really careful if you upset those.
10183 10183 we really need companies working together during this crisis and talking about the survival of the fittest could be seen as quite unhelpful.
10185 10185 We determined that Asahi selling the beer and cider brands would be sufficient to address our competition concerns and provide an opportunity for another business to play an important role in a relatively concentrated industry,.
10186 10186 We should let the 95-year-old man rest, have some compassion for him, let the younger leaders take over the fight while he continues to support as an advisor,.
10188 10188 While new risks could emerge, none of the main sources of recent recessions-oil shocks, inflationary overheating, and financial imbalances-seem too concerning for now. As a result, the prospects for a soft landing look better than widely thought.
10189 10189 While the exact timing is highly uncertain and relapses are plausible, the assumption of a gradual recovery reflects the potential contributions from factors such as effective mitigation and testing actions, weather effects, medical breakthroughs or adaptation by firms and consumers,.
10191 10191 If US producers are unable to source intermediate inputs from China, they may have to cut production if no substitutes are readily available,.
10197 10197 Oh Peter for God 's sake man. This is the problem-people want association with the Royals, they want to exploit them. He should be flogging milk made here,.
10202 10202 It is possible that toys or other stimuli may reduce stress or boredom, which might improve health, welfare and productivity.
10203 10203 It could be controversial, but not at this meeting ... The market is focused on inflation and the inflation target,.
10204 10204 It [ stimulus ] ca n't do any harm, it can do some good, but it 's not going to save you if the United States, Europe and China go pear-shaped.
10206 10206 That most countries have chosen not to impose draconian blanket restrictions on Chinese travelers is likely to have been decisions made in consideration of the countries' long-term economic cooperation, and confidence in their own medical systems and epidemic control capacities. In line with recommendations by the World Health Organization, many governments have made the rational choice of not restricting travel and trade with China too much in the face of the epidemic,.
10207 10207 There are increases in the credit card delinquency rate that make you wonder whether some parts of the population are not doing so well, or whether this is just a result of more relaxed lending standards. It 's something we are looking into.
10213 10213 The question is not if some of these things will happen to you. They will. Today I want to talk about what happens next. About the things you can do to overcome adversity, no matter what form it takes or when it hits you .... You will be defined not just by what you achieve, but by how you survive.
10215 10215 If you were thinking you were going to make $ 200,000 a year this year and $ 500,000 the year after that, what would you do ? You 'd probably go out and buy a new car, would n't you ?.
10218 10218 When we encroach on nature, when we destroy forest, when we degrade the environment, then we are disturbing what is supposed to be left undisturbed,.
10219 10219 If we do n't take care of nature, we ca n't take care of ourselves. And as we hurtle towards a population of 10 billion people on this planet, we need to go into this future armed with nature as our strongest ally.
10224 10224 by slowing down, not driving while impaired through drink, drugs or fatigue, by not driving while using a phone, by wearing a seatbelt and always sharing the road more carefully with pedestrians and cyclists.
10226 10226 Someone in the community must know why these boys were murdered,.
10228 10228 Government funding is not going to be immediately restored because the KOSI report, which is gone to the gardaí, did say that the association was not fit for government funding, and there were a lot of other conditions which they thought should be met, which included compliance with corporate governance,.
10229 10229 The US appears to have squandered the advantage we gain from having observed how Covid-19 played out in other countries ....
10231 10231 Continued sanctions against Iran could have devastating consequences for other nations in the region.
10232 10232 For now, selectively deploying micro-policies to service sectors and other vulnerable industries would be a more effective set of responses than adjusting the ( policy ) rate,.
10234 10234 Meet elected representatives in your areas. Tell them to arrange a meeting with the enumerators where common citizens would be present. At the meeting, ask the enumerators to give an assurance that they would be collecting data for Census only. We should not oppose Census. But we should not allow the Centre to collect data for NPR along with the data for Census,.
10240 10240 should inspire policy makers and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to roll out national programs that aim to improve quality and reduce spending in a randomized manner so that we can understand whether they are truly effective,.
10243 10243 the ECB must not lose sight of the exit from loose monetary policy. Our current inflation target is understandable, forward-looking and realistic,.
10246 10246 Employment is down, every sector is affected. Right now, you need to make the patient survive. And then you can think about making him walk.
10249 10249 and the fall will be crazy because we had a lot booked already. Some of the postponements will be getting into January or February 2021.
10252 10252 The literature studying medical marijuana laws is constantly trying to understand whether these policies provide additional opportunities for pain management,.
10253 10253 And then all of a sudden we could have 10 to 20 cases in here because we did n't do something,.
10255 10255 Paid sick leave and paid time off was starting to come up to a national stage. I think this brings it center stage. So many millions of workers are not protected under any laws.
10260 10260 Wow, this thing is probably 50 percent glass it seems like.
10263 10263 Any evaluation of digital currencies should consider both policy and business objectives, as well as the unique circumstances facing different economies around the world to fully evaluate their risks and benefits,.
10265 10265 I would start with a $ 1,000 check for every American, sent out as quickly as possible,.

10269 10269 even if it takes a little longer to contain it, there are such solid fundamentals for the real estate market, things will play out very well over the long haul.
10271 10271 We are still lacking in inventory ... Inventory availability will be the key to consistent future gains. With housing starts hovering at 1.6 million in December and January, along with the favorable mortgage rates, among other factors, 2020 has so far presented a very positive sales climate. Moreover, the latest stock market correction could provide exceptional, even lower mortgage rates for a few weeks, and that would help bring about a noticeable upturn in the coming months.
10276 10276 He would do anything but you screwed up, you also got corrected from Coach Ed. If you were n't doing your grades, if you were n't playing, if you were disrespecting your teacher, you were n't playing. If you disrespect your coach, you were n't playing.
10281 10281 There are downside risks from global growth and the possibility uncertainties over future trading relationships could remain entrenched. With relatively limited space to cut Bank Rate, if evidence builds that the weakness in activity could persist, risk management considerations would favour a relatively prompt response.
10291 10291 In the schools which we believe can be reopened and classes be resumed, ( it may ) start on Feb. 3,.
10296 10296 No one was hurt or met their fate at the butt of a rifle,.
10297 10297 I think [ globalisation ] created an opportunity, but we have to manage the social institutions to make it possible. Compared to the United States or United Kingdom, Aussies are relatively trade friendly-provided it looks after the workers and pays good wages.
10298 10298 Growth is the economy 's default mode. Recessions are an anomaly, caused by a large, rapid, sustained shock to the system. If you do n't have a why, the answer to when is never.
10299 10299 If the layoffs become furloughs and not permanent job cuts, and people get back to work fairly quickly, this is not going to be that severe,.
10302 10302 executive remuneration should reflect stakeholder responsibility.
10308 10308 As a result, we 've decided to direct what would have been this person 's salary into additional severance pay and health benefits for those laid off who need it the most.
10313 10313 History is on their side that a ( 4 per cent or ) 4.5 per cent rate will probably get them through, although they do need to monitor it.
10314 10314 I think the skills of the students and recent graduates coming out into the analytics world has surprised me,.
10319 10319 The most major issue to address is the weakness in credit growth. There need to be policies that can resuscitate credit growth but at the same time do n't create further NPA problems,.
10322 10322 The accumulative loss of 2020-21 could be $ 9 trillion which is equal to the size of combined economies of Germany and Japan. It is the first time since the great recession that both advance and emerging economies are in a recession. If the pandemic does not recede in H2 2020 and the financial condition worsens, in this case the global economy will fall another three percent in 2020. And if crisis rolls over into 2021, it will reduce global GDP by eight percent based on baseline scenario,.
10326 10326 Blockchains in some ways are a double-edged sword. But this kind of system signals the dawn of a new economic paradigm that must be embraced and explored rather than feared and ignored.
10328 10328 In the worst-case scenario, market may fall further 10-20 per cent due to sustained outflow of foreign institutional investors' money,.
10331 10331 Big old trees are particularly at risk of destruction as they have termite damage and hollows where embers can intrude,.
10337 10337 We thought, ` If we 've found this, other people must have seen it.' And what we found was that everyone seemed to be surprised,.
10339 10339 After previously having appointed the chairman positions, I thought it was important to have a full election now that the party has backed an open process,.
10340 10340 Hopefully this coronavirus can be an opportunity for the government to pass these regulations.
10342 10342 At this stage, Iran is pretty desperate to end the sanctions and it believes by escalating terrorist attacks it can get the US to pull back. But, Trump administration is unlikely to pull back if it comes to escalating tensions,.
10344 10344 If China gets hit, then the rest of the emerging market countries get hit as well, because the ETFs are in emerging markets generally, and the heavy weighting in China effects the index,.
10345 10345 He can now in his head think, ` OK, we 've got 350 billion [ dollars ] at the [ Small Business Administration ], and we 've got 500 over at Treasury. They 're gon na have this list of problems.' And he knows that.
10350 10350 We may not be so lucky this time.
10352 10352 Arth or wealth is among these noble pursuits. The colour lavender also suggested measures like increasing government spending and tax cuts.
10358 10358 The last time we saw business investment decline for three quarters or more was heading into the 2008-2009 recession,.
10359 10359 This ca n't be the only environmental case that can not be certified,.
10367 10367 I think most businesses and certainly the behemoths in the U.S. and elsewhere will not fail to go back to normal business practices,.
10368 10368 I worry that the jobs that older workers who lost their jobs can do are n't safe for them to do right now.
10373 10373 The migrant workers, who have now gone back to the villages, may not return soon, because not much employment opportunities may be available for them in the urban areas immediately after the lockdown is lifted,.
10375 10375 Though the overall approach in the Budget coincides with Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's appeal for the use of indigenous products, tax concessions to foreign portfolio investors and FDI in education should have been avoided as they are retrograde steps.
10380 10380 We need to do more biological and genomic studies to see if the differences are due to access to healthcare or if it is a biological difference,.
10382 10382 If the challengers were stronger, the course Modi and the party have taken ... they would not be taking.
10384 10384 In an emergency, when interest rates fall to zero, you can buy a much wider range of assets.
10385 10385 one indication of their diligence is that, when they were paid on a piece-work basis in agriculture, they earned up to twice as much as other laborers.
10392 10392 I think somebody ate a bat and the bat was sick and it got the person sick and there was a tarantula who bit the person and the tarantula was even sicker than the bat ...,.
10393 10393 It is too early to know with certainty whether these funds will be insufficient to cover the costs associated with Maryland 's appropriate and timely response to COVID-19 's spread in our State,.
10396 10396 For someone like me, if you bought your house 30 or 40 years ago, California is a nice place to live,.
10397 10397 But it could just be something coincidental, so we should n't jump to conclusions,.
10400 10400 I do think recession risks, generally, are high and will remain high because of where we are in the business cycle,.
10403 10403 I think she would be ecstatic today if she knew her name sake is on a product that is helping people right now,.
10407 10407 We are beginning evacuation of our citizens from Wuhan and Hubei. Before the end of the day we will clarify how many of our citizens are there. Preliminary data suggests that 300 people are staying in Wuhan and 341 are in the Hubei Province,.
10408 10408 Disinfection measures, control of personnel and the use of individual sanitation protection kits have been tightened. A special quarantine checkpoint is open. Rospotrebnadzor keeps all flights under control. I would like to point out that most passengers arriving at this terminal are transit travelers, who are to leave Russia,.
10409 10409 Judging by the situation in other states, starting this moment, that is, after nearly a month, countries start to document an increase of the infection or a so-called plateau. We consider this week and the beginning of next week in Moscow and the Moscow Region as the period when the number of infections will increase. We would like to hope that this increase will be followed by a plateau,.
10412 10412 If you 're going to buy a house, you do n't borrow at the Fed 's rate. You borrow at a 30-year mortgage rate. If that rate goes down, that might influence you to buy a house. Or if the corporate borrowing rate goes down, that might influence firms to expand their operations.
10413 10413 It 's double or quits for the ECB,.
10417 10417 We are a bit battle-hardened here more than others, but that is not going to save the battle-weary if this lasts,.
10424 10424 This is an economic war which the Kremlin considered to be a ` walk in the park' but which could end up being a catastrophic defeat,.
10425 10425 was a major disseminator -- if not the principal transmission vehicle -- of coronavirus infection.
10427 10427 Answers to questions such as, ` When should we relax social-distancing measures -- and for whom ?' or, ` How many ventilators are needed in hospitals ?' are vital to our economic recovery and public health outcomes,.
10429 10429 That does n't mean that every gun policy that 's proposed should be enacted, but maybe this one should because the evidence is so clear.
10431 10431 Tilney All Saints has one of the oldest associations with it in the world, with records going back to 1453. It 's important to have it back but we wo n't be collecting money for the church, or ploughing up any gardens.
10432 10432 if people acted at the level of rationality presumed in the standard economics textbooks I was brought up with, the world 's standard of living would be measurably higher ; but, in fact, they do not.
10434 10434 The [ paid sick leave provision ] excludes workers at big companies like Whole Foods and McDonald 's as well as those at Walmart and Target, whose CEOs appeared with President Trump on Friday afternoon as he declared a national health emergency,.
10435 10435 Traditionally education has been very much a state and local matter, so the Trump administration would n't be unreasonable to say they defer to the states and cities,.
10436 10436 In our study, virtually all of the association of air pollution with dementia seemed to be through the presence or the development of CVD.
10439 10439 The ECB is ready to do everything in its mandate to counter market turmoil that disrupts monetary policy transmission, otherwise monetary policy can not function,.
10440 10440 The historical standard deviation of the weekly change is 17,876. If claims jump to 2 million, that is 96 standard deviations and beyond anything we have seen in history.
10442 10442 These cells are not happy, but may have the capacity to survive a viral infection.
10446 10446 Of course, it can be done, it is doable,.
10448 10448 We 'll see if proning helps, and if so, how long should they be in the prone position,.
10449 10449 can gain by self-preferencing but of course they can lose by that as well.
10451 10451 It has long been known that teaching is a stressful and challenging career and we wanted to see if the mental health and wellbeing of teachers had improved or declined, especially in light of government promises to ease the burden upon the teaching profession,.
10457 10457 I thought, well, this is a place and a time that I can apply my skills right here.
10463 10463 We 've just got to stay the course. I told them the other night, in my own business, around 2000, we could 've busted as a business. We stayed the course. They have something very good going on.
10468 10468 Blue-collar manufacturing workers -- at least as I see it -- do n't appear to make up a huge percentage of Sanders backers,.
10469 10469 Clearly, we can not randomly assign individuals to locations with different temperatures to identify a clear causal impact of temperature on self-reported mental health,.
10470 10470 If all this business service-related activity is shut off, then I think that will be yet another significant or noticeable reduction to economic activity in both places,.
10472 10472 Large swings in asset prices can quickly put markets and institutions under pressure,.
10473 10473 One of the lessons is that there probably needs to be more attention paid to either redundancies or alternative suppliers should a particular supplier not be available,.
10476 10476 That 's, of course, a risk to them and to everyone else because it may increase contagion.
10481 10481 It would have been pretty awkward for him to stand next to him if Joyce was elected as his deputy,.
10483 10483 We 're moving massive amounts of carbon through this province, all largely invisible to people. These are pipelines to the sky. It 's like taking carbon and sticking it in the air. Sooner or later, somewhere along the way, it gets burned ; it goes up there.
10486 10486 Adding to evidence dating back as early as the 1950s, our findings strongly suggest that psilocybin therapy is a promising means of improving the emotional, psychological, and spiritual well-being of patients with life-threatening cancer,.
10491 10491 If we have 3.5 %, we have rip-roaring growth. North of 4 %, the market will fade.
10493 10493 COVID-19 will need to break through the job market firewall if it is to do significant damage to the economy. The firewall has some cracks, but judging by the February employment gain it should be strong enough to weather most scenarios.
10497 10497 This means that there is a likelihood that these assessments could change rapidly.
10498 10498 This should not happen. So we should find a way to increase SDRs or for the Europeans to offer their SDRs as a way out,.
10500 10500 The ideal thing would be to target the payments [ at ] the people who are most vulnerable, the people who lose their jobs who are working in industries that are severely affected by the coronavirus,.
10503 10503 The issue is not what people think of me or Mark personally. The issue is how are we doing as a company ? How do we provide a great service, and how do we prevent some of the harm ?.
10506 10506 Many consumers may have been tricked by these price displays into thinking they were getting great discounts,.
10508 10508 Our decision will help companies urgently address potential shortages or other constraints on the supply of crucial medical equipment,.
10510 10510 We will focus on our activity on websites that have a lot of use, that consumers rely on. And we will take action when we think they are misleading.
10511 10511 So the ramifications would be quite serious, but I do n't want to get ahead of ourselves, we 're at an early stage of an investigation,.
10512 10512 The conditions provide transparency over what is proposed and if major concerns are identified, the ACCC is able to revoke the interim authorisation, or require amendments.
10514 10514 Misleading claims about health or nutritional benefits harm consumers as they often pay a higher price for products without receiving the benefits claimed,.
10520 10520 Economy has declined in one or two quarters but it will soon be improved. The share market is in good condition. The economy will also be in good condition,.
10523 10523 We have seen an extraordinary spike in requests for the IMF emergency financing, some 80 countries have placed requests and more are likely to come. Normally, we never have more than a handful of requests at the same time.
10530 10530 We already see tentative signs of stabilization, with recent data suggesting that trade and industrial output are bottoming out,.
10542 10542 Unlike the United States or Europe, which can spend 10 % more of GDP without fear of a ratings downgrade, we already entered this crisis with a huge fiscal deficit, and will have to spend yet more,.
10545 10545 so a natural question is whether policymakers should add even further accommodation to spur a faster return of inflation to our goal.
10546 10546 nothing to write home about -- higher or lower,.
10547 10547 If market illiquidity continues, I will support our taking further actions to address funding needs,.
10548 10548 have reoriented their supply chains away from US firms, which means these exports may be permanently lost.
10551 10551 If you do n't do what you are doing now, you can actually end up in a worse situation because economic activity will collapse so severely that your debt-to-GDP will be even worse. So things could be worse if you did n't do what is needed right now. I think that is something everybody recognises at this point,.
10555 10555 Once the recovery has happened and we are past the pandemic phase, for advanced economies it would be essential to undertake a broad-based stimulus,.
10556 10556 if inflation stays well below target, interest rates should also stay low for that period of time.
10557 10557 if epidemic and containment measures continued for a longer period of time, emerging and developing economies are going to be more severely affected, or difficult financial conditions will persist.
10559 10559 Now no one thinks about doing things together anymore.
10568 10568 He wanted me to have a drink with him and wanted to talk. I think I thought for a moment that he was sorry and that he realised he had gone too far,.
10569 10569 It should n't have happened but both of us agreed it would be put behind us.
10572 10572 There 's some of that going on, but I think that there is also a general slowing of demand for these kinds of vehicles in the economy,.
10573 10573 What 's hard is to recognize the invisible commitments one should make to thinking, reflecting, creating, investing in learning and growth towards something more important, rather than lots of little things,.
10574 10574 From these figures, we can not generalise the trend as every area has its own set of problems. But the death of leopards in road and rail mishaps is a worrisome trend. Increased traffic volume and speed of vehicles due to road widening are causing many accidents,.
10575 10575 I think the only way is to use existing institutions with existing instruments.
10576 10576 I would like to stress that the government will endeavor to help small and medium enterprises,.
10578 10578 C ’ mon, Noel, we can then go back to our amazing solo careers.
10579 10579 It 'll be 50/50, and I 'll be choosing who 's in the band as well, because if he thinks I 'm joining the High Flying Birds but calling it Oasis, he 's got another thing coming.
10580 10580 Sorry to everybody who came to the gig tnight in Hamburg my voice was not there and if I 'd have carried on I 'd have done more damage to it I love you all and hope you understand I 'll make it up to you LG x ( sic ).
10584 10584 Well, we have to look at everything because we 're not winning, so you 're not winning, to me, you have to assess everything. I think anybody would want to do that,.
10585 10585 In the next two to three weeks, if we act decisively, we may be able to flatten the curve and then when the storm comes it will not be as brutal as we see in Europe.
10586 10586 If we need an example of what the lack of multilateralism looks like, we 're seeing it today. If one of us has the virus, all of us have it.
10588 10588 Since I took office here, I would say he is one of my most valuable ` sparing partners' regarding former colleagues,.
10591 10591 The global community should have invested a great deal more on prevention in poor countries,.
10593 10593 The fact that China is five times more important than it was back then means just mathematically, you 'd expect the impact would be much bigger today than it was then,.
10595 10595 There is no reason for this shock to turn into the experience of 2008, if we handled it well,.
10599 10599 about funding only deep green activities or blacklisting dark brown ones.
10604 10604 Students who need to remain on campus will also receive instruction remotely and must prepare for severely limited on-campus activities and interactions. All graduate students will transition to remote work wherever possible.
10608 10608 Public transport remains one of our biggest risk areas in the spread of the virus. We must, therefore, do everything in our power to protect both the citizens who rely on public transport and those who operate the system from exposure and possible infection,.
10611 10611 At the meeting today, allies called for restraint and de-escalation. A new conflict would be in no-one 's interest. So Iran must refrain from further violence and provocations,.
10612 10612 There is now a process inside NATO, but also with our partners and not least with partners in the region -- with Iraq, Jordan and other partners in the region -- about if NATO is going to do more, what more we could we do,.
10621 10621 We will make sure that the US dollar is pulled back as a currency that people prefer to use. They should n't do that, they are violating the law and we want to enforce the use of the Zimbabwe dollar,.
10624 10624 One of my core beliefs is that a liberalised aviation sector can be a great catalyst for global economic and human development. At Qatar Airways, we believe in connecting people with no borders, only horizons.
10627 10627 We need to diversify our faculty so we can better represent the student population that we proudly serve,.
10629 10629 You 'll probably get 0.1 per cent ( on savings ) in a bank account but credit card rates are up to 24 per cent,.
10632 10632 If you 're focused on reward programs and you 're carrying balances on your credit cards,.
10653 10653 I think a lot of people on Wall Street did n't take the virus seriously enough until it was their towns where cases were being discovered and their kids who were being sent home from school.
10657 10657 nobody should lose their job or their income because of the virus.
10659 10659 So we can come in and be part of the last 10 years of building a complete community.
10662 10662 The devastating cyclones in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe led to massive destruction of critical infrastructure. The same applies to coastal states, which are more vulnerable to coastal erosion and floods. Infrastructure investment must now be climate-resilient.
10664 10664 If we do go on permanent DST I will be interested to see how it works out, but my guess is that people would say in a few years it is n't a good idea.
10666 10666 It is likely that these electricity data -- which can be produced with a lag of about a day and are available for different regions of the country -- will also provide the first clear signal of when the current free fall will end,.
10668 10668 There are a couple of times I have said things or taken positions that were more expedient than they were based upon conviction. I remember those things precisely, and I regret them enormously,.
10670 10670 This threatened to unleash a perilous macro-financial feedback loop that, if left unaddressed, would have put at risk the ECB 's price stability mandate and endangered financial stability more broadly.
10673 10673 Well, you 're not going to guarantee absolutely anything at this stage but if you have the four main parties, the stakeholders here, I 'm determined that should n't happen and I 'm fairly confident the goodwill is there to ensure it does n't.
10674 10674 I think the bookies have me getting in just marginally. I do n't know, it 's very difficult to tell.
10682 10682 I think they 're all trying, but they do n't sit on our side of the fence. They do n't know what it 's like,.
10684 10684 The potential risk to the Australian economy I think is bigger than SARS and the truth is really none of us know how this is going to play out,.
10685 10685 Today, China is a larger part of the global economy and it is more closely integrated, including with Australia, so the international spillovers could be larger than they were back in 2003.
10686 10686 I think it 's unlikely, but it is possible,.
10693 10693 the government just does n't have the space to do anything dramatic or drastic,.
10696 10696 Will Iranian producers be able to produce ? That takes reforms. And can they export some of that ? Because any economy needs foreign exchange.
10700 10700 I thought it was some mischief by the ` tukde tukde' gang.
10702 10702 Sir, did i abuse you or your daughter ? Abusive term used in return to a comment is BIGOTRY.
10704 10704 For a change, I am on the side of Rajinikanth on the E.V.R Naicker 1971 rally issue of parading Ram and Sita in a derogatory. This is a fact and Cho had published it in Thuglak. If the cine actor stays firm I will back him in courts if he wants.
10706 10706 I am hearing that quite a lot of civil servants who were doing Brexit have been moved temporarily to coronavirus and that must delay the putting into U.K. law what was EU law,.
10707 10707 If our permanent calendar was adopted, you 'd be simplifying all kinds of commercial life, and just life in general would be a lot simpler,.
10711 10711 Labourers and daily wage earners could face difficulties over the next three months,.
10713 10713 In a way that preserves jobs and economic opportunity, but also preserves the lives of birds as well. We can do both,.
10715 10715 NEPA requires federal agencies to engage the public and consider the real environmental costs and potential consequences of all types of projects, for example : the impact of an oil spill to coastal communities, the impact of a new levee or dam on flooding in neighboring communities, the impact of a pipeline explosion for a tribal community and whether or not a new bridge we build will be washed away by extreme weather fueled by climate change,.
10716 10716 It 's not surprising that she would look out for California, especially after the president refused to shake her hand.
10719 10719 If there was an announcement of another extension ... that will freak people out.
10721 10721 That pace really continued until about 10 or 15 years ago, when the city ran out of land. In 2009, the province allowed Barrie to bring 2,800 hectares of land in from Innisfil and it has been 10 years in the making to plan for those new communities.
10722 10722 This space has had a few different iterations, but there 's a portion of it still that has still, if you walk through it, got the carpet and the lighting from Woolworths,.
10723 10723 Air travel may be the first thing that comes back,.
10733 10733 If this is true, the severity and death rate could be much lower than anticipated, and we could be closer to herd immunity than projected,.
10735 10735 Stray animals can be quite resourceful, particularly in cities, as they quickly adapt to change. But water scarcity affects birds the worst ; sparrows and other small birds have been observed to be the worst victims,.
10736 10736 a huge number of people will be pushed into dire poverty or even starvation by the combination of the loss of their livelihoods and interruptions in the standard delivery mechanisms,.
10760 10760 It probably would have cost us $ 75,000-85,000 in architect fees had we utilized an architect rather than doing it ourselves.
10763 10763 you can not vote for them. They are not a political alternative,.
10764 10764 Despite what people would like to believe, there 's not a lot of evidence you can reduce health spending by spending more in other areas.
10765 10765 I hope we have sent a nice message on the continent. The fact that we have national constitutions and electoral laws must count for something in the conduct of general elections. Those that are delegated or appointed to discharge the task of overseeing elections derive that authority from the people.
10766 10766 For international observers, if what they are going to continue to do is election tourism, we should scrap it. It is no better than a cartel protecting each other. But if we want to continue with them, let 's redefine their role. It should not be a tick-the-box exercise.
10767 10767 Our promise that Malawians should have three meals per day still stands. We want a Malawi where people are empowered and live happily,.
10768 10768 If you did n't have Social Security, our poverty rates among the elderly would probably triple,.
10774 10774 I thought it was magical that someone can come up with these beautiful pieces of music,.
10782 10782 I do n't think we have anything shaping up like 2008 or 1929, particularly in the United States,.
10783 10783 I think the math really adds up here, because, currently, about a billion dollars is spent on the legal costs and that is basically money taken away from the people who need it to get better. So, if you actually redirect that money from process to treatment of the injured, that can do a lot of good.
10784 10784 The supply chain extends to multiple countries, and they all have to come together to make a product happen. So any disruption at one location could be critical ... So you have to make sure you have strategic options, that you are no longer dependent on just one location. Have some redundancy in your supply chain. Identify the points of possible disruptions and inventory accordingly.
10786 10786 It 's an open question whether the vice president could have done something about that. But that 's what he had to live with.
10788 10788 We do n't know why our neighbouring country banned palm oil. There should be some other politics behind it,.
10791 10791 What would take years in a financial crisis has happened in days in this health crisis,.
10792 10792 I 've never seen Congress move so fast to do something so large. Unfortunately, the problem may be larger and faster,.
10793 10793 If we had paid leave, we 'd be in better shape right now.
10794 10794 This would a critical floor of social insurance for hundreds of millions of Americans and would help the economy rebound more quickly when we are past the virus lockdown phase,.
10795 10795 If you ask people what kinds of policies they would like to see, a carbon tax is way down on the list and does not get a majority of support except among left-leaning people and, you know, California,.
10809 10809 explicitly or implicitly, condition the recapitalization ... on certain policy actions.
10812 10812 If the U.S. has n't stabilized, it 's difficult to see any significant stabilization elsewhere the world,.
10814 10814 should have been concentrated on the economy and is instead distracted by political things.
10816 10816 and there is no human being that can just monitor all these transactions and make the right decisions.
10821 10821 could well say, I 've been paying rent on this giant, expensive shiny box for quite some time. It turns out that I do n't need to do this, because 80 per cent of what I used it for was actually done by you in your spare room.
10833 10833 In those jurisdictions, fiscal as well as monetary policy may be needed to get inflation expectations up,.
10834 10834 Do n't come near me or my box.
10835 10835 If India can hold on to its democratic institutions, it can come out on top.
10836 10836 It is imperative not just to lift people out of extreme poverty ; it is also important to make sure that, in the long run, they do not get stuck just above the extreme poverty line due to a lack of opportunities that might impede progress toward better livelihoods.
10837 10837 If the gardens were opened today we would have been able to salvage 40 % of the first flush teas which is the largest revenue earner for Darjeeling tea industry. The chief minister has now sought time. If the gardens reopen in Wednesday then we could still salvage 15 % -20 % of the first flush crop. A further delay will completely ruin the first flush teas,.
10838 10838 If we keep up our current strategy of suppression based on indiscriminate social distance for 12 to 18 months, most of us will still be alive. It is our economy that will be dead.
10840 10840 Many Americans have never heard of a ` chief equity officer,' but it may be the hottest new job in municipal government.
10841 10841 I know that there have been, over the past, say, 50 years, quite a few other companies embark upon this, but for whatever reason they could n't hang in there with it. It 's really difficult.
10847 10847 Let 's be smart and think about this. We want to get people back to work, get the economies going again, let 's build back better.
10849 10849 Therefore, it can not be depended upon to adequately stimulate the economy, to counter the weakening business and especially the small businessmen and women and growing unemployment and underemployment,.
10852 10852 I do n't claim to be in the mainstream of economists ... I would bring my own perspective. But I think the intellectual diversity strengthens the discussion.
10855 10855 I think it was fairly evident early on, the prospect of finding Michael was quite remote,.
10856 10856 There is still a risk of a further tightening in financial conditions that could expose financial vulnerabilities,.
10859 10859 Before assistance is the step of taking away all of the obstacles that they have put in our ordinary trade, whether it be food and medical supplies, or any other trade. So, I think the first step is not sending a small package of medicine, [ but ] is to take away, to lift sanctions on food and medical supplies,.
10864 10864 It 's likely that ( the economy ) will be impacted throughout the first half.
10871 10871 The U.S.-China relationship has deteriorated to a new post-Tiananmen low at a particularly unfortunate time, when the two countries ought to be joining forces to limit the ravages wrought by the pandemic on public health, economic activity and financial markets,.
10872 10872 There 'll be no substantive talks until Cubs know outcome of service time grievance. What 's the point of discussing deals if u do n't know what you 're trading ?.
10873 10873 We would [ normally ] produce somewhere in the vicinity of 250 and 300 tonnes of honey,.
10878 10878 If the reason for our existence there is to overthrow Assad, they should say it openly. You are not saying this. So why are we staying there ?.
10881 10881 Although there is optimism that increasing expenditure on education could improve learning, quite often there had been no accountability on how such funds are used to benefit learners, especially in the rural areas,.
10887 10887 The next step on this journey is now to look at how we can merge our skills, staff experience and customer loyalty to make a bigger more sustainable Business with far greater solutions and services that our clients will benefit from.
10889 10889 Public market capital is not by its nature partnership capital. That 's the proposition we make. We represent a pool of patient, constructive capital [ and ] offer an attractive, alternative path [ to an IPO ]. These businesses will become an important part of the Canadian economy ... and eventually many go public -- but they 'll probably go public later.
10890 10890 Tax rebates and policies aimed at ensuring credit availability to small businesses are likely to become priorities for Congress.
10892 10892 The real problem is that in a country like ours, 30 per cent of the population will not be able to provide the kind of documentation needed and therefore runs the risk of being excluded .... remember that 30 per cent of the Indian population is almost 400 million people. Even if the government is well-intentioned, at the lower levels such an exercise can become the source of immense harassment. The apprehensions ( of the citizenry ) are not unreasonable .....
10893 10893 AI is a statistical-inference technology that learns by example. This means that if we allow AI systems to learn from ` garbage' examples, we will end up with a statistical-inference model that is really good at producing ` garbage' inferences.
10898 10898 The EU institutions will drive convergence, which is a mistake in my view. Already the Eurogroup was where difficult decisions were made, and those outside will doubly feel in a ` second ring' - like it or not,.
10899 10899 as due north as it might.
10902 10902 no building should be approved on local green community spaces.
10907 10907 The US is currently enjoying another stock market boom which, if history is any guide, also stands to end in a bust. For four decades the US economy has been trapped in a ` Groundhog Day' cycle in which policy engineered new stock market booms to cover the tracks of previous busts. But as each new boom ameliorates, it does not recuperate the prior damage done to income distribution and shared prosperity.
10909 10909 a joke about Jews in ovens that I heard when I was in college or a swastika being spray-painted on the front lawn of my high school growing up.
10910 10910 means having banks we can put our money in and be confident that it 's secure.
10911 10911 plunged as if no bottom was in sight : no one wants to catch a falling knife.
10915 10915 In the case of ... may epidemic of illiteracy. Iyong sinasabi na 70,000 learners in Bicol can not read. Palagay ko ay kailangan i-clarify, ano ang ibig sabihin natin ng ` can not read.' Kung ` no read, no write,' hindi iyan tama,.
10916 10916 The share of wealth going to the U.S. billionaire class has exploded in recent decades. Therefore, they can bid up the prices on the fanciest mansions in the country as Jeff Bezos just did with the Beverly Hills mansion,.
10917 10917 There is a rise in rural unemployment because of the stress in agriculture. We need to deal with that issue on priority. For example, we could set up training agencies and provide opportunities in other areas.
10919 10919 I 'm so happy to see the children recover, not to mention the economic assistance the Chinese side has offered. Such good deeds deserve our respect. The seeds of friendship have been planted in our hearts. May China-Myanmar ` Phauphaw' ( fraternal ) friendship be carried on from generation to generation,.
10921 10921 So I wound up speaking to the Governor of Massachusetts and said would he allow us to give 300,000 of the masks to the people of New York City, and he immediately, Governor Baker, said yes.
10922 10922 We are far, far too early to even begin contemplating ... stepping back or stepping away from these measures at this point in time, because this virus is out there and it would just come straight back at us,.
10926 10926 For example, if all of a sudden you have a lot of people working at home, the patterns of restaurant usage are going to change dramatically,.
10927 10927 Money and payment systems are founded on trust in the currency-whether cash or digital - and this trust is something that only the central bank can ensure.
10930 10930 PAALS is in desperate need of puppy raisers either full time or weekends to support them.
10931 10931 significant if we go to the suggested regionalisation of representation.
10933 10933 We are committed to work alongside the Government of Mali to ensure migration can continue to promote Mali 's economic, social and cultural development,.
10934 10934 You can understand why people do n't want to go to restaurants, shopping malls, not to mention travel,.
10936 10936 The economy was weak for a long time and the rebound came more slowly for the typical person. It 's not surprising, then, that the typical person is asking whether the financial system and the people who regulate it really have their best interest in mind. I 'm a former regulator, and I can understand why some people feel they 've been ill-served.
10937 10937 the opportunity cost of anything of value is what you must give up to get it.
10942 10942 Clearly, they want to delay any further damaging stuff about Tom Watson while the peerage is still being considered. If he can get the peerage, he is invulnerable.
10943 10943 I think that says something about Boris Johnson 's own abilities of management of his own government.
10944 10944 This is not about providing just a carte blanche assurance or a cheque to people and it is right that there is due process here.
10950 10950 There is a whole block within the Democratic Party that believes themselves to be socialists. What response should the Democratic Party have to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren ?.
10953 10953 If we and the fiscal system provide the economy with enough money and businesses get started again, then there is no reason to think the whole thing would turn into deflation.
10954 10954 I understand that there are many who reason this way, because that is the way we are used to thinking, but monetary policy is something completely different currently when the main purpose is to keep the Swedish economy going.
10956 10956 KRCC will remain KRCC and donors can count on the fact that that will strengthen our reporting right here in southern Colorado,.
10961 10961 Price appreciation has rapidly accelerated, and areas that are relatively unaffordable or declining in affordability are starting to experience slower job growth,.
10963 10963 We must improve affordability by building more homes in line with local job market growth.
10967 10967 I would say, builders : build mid-priced homes and you can sell them,.
10969 10969 This problem will drain household resources, weigh on the economy, and could undermine efforts to slow the spread of Covid-19 by encouraging people to take on extra work,.
10971 10971 Budgets should be aimed at solving problems,.
10973 10973 Ensuring the anonymity of these individuals is paramount. If you are aware of their identities, please respect their privacy so that they can focus completely on their health. The last thing they need -- or any of us would want for them -- is public attention and scrutiny.
10976 10976 no virtual gathering can possibly match the splendor of our usual festivities.
10977 10977 Hand sanitisers can be made with any kind of alcohol but normally it is made with isopropyl alcohol which is very scarce now. Ethanol is a very good substitute and Carew & Co is the only source of the chemical in Bangladesh,.
10978 10978 If you look at the underlying fundamentals for the U.S. economy, they are pretty good,.
10979 10979 There are a lot of scenarios that could play out,.
10984 10984 could get worse depending on many variable factors, including the duration of the pandemic.
10991 10991 If we were to just bring the Middle East to par with the more advanced economies ... over the next years, there would be $ 1 trillion more in output for everyone to share,.
10993 10993 In some low income countries debt at levels are higher than before the global crisis. It requires all of us to think about unintended consequences,.
10996 10996 Let 's say for this quarter, it 's very likely there would be some negative impact,.
11004 11004 In schools, which we believe can already be reopened and classes can resume, it will start on Feb. 3,.
11006 11006 The chief needs to be out in the community and known by the people. That way, if he makes a mistake, people may say, ` He 's OK. He 's a good guy.
11010 11010 Given the clear upward trend in mortgage demand in the fall, it would be reasonable to expect sales to be trending higher, but lack of inventory might be holding back transactions volumes in some markets,.
11012 11012 They may show a little bit more generosity in terms of loans or various regulations rather than in terms of hard cash,.
11013 11013 They will return to putting solar on their roofs to lower their bills, which will make the state 's solar over-generation issue worse and do nothing to address peak demand. It seems to me California has not learned the lesson in the Puget Sound experience.
11015 11015 If the federal government does not impose such a lockdown, we believe it is likely that effectively all fifty states will do so eventually, with the additional delay costing many thousands of more lives, and much greater economic destruction.
11016 11016 Without marketing or investor relations responsibilities, the investment team 's resources are now entirely dedicated to investment analysis, selection, monitoring, and portfolio management.
11021 11021 A payroll tax cut like the president wants would n't help the elderly, non-employed, who are at the most risk from the virus,.
11022 11022 Much of this would only be necessary if economic growth is near or below zero due to the coronavirus epidemic.
11024 11024 We 're heading into May, and businesses are looking at months, not weeks, of being deprived of sales, being shut down or having dramatic drops in sales,.
11026 11026 I think, first, that [ Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth ] Warren and Sanders are not radicals,.
11027 11027 in a positive and constructive sense to refer to a set of a priori plausible ideas and discourses describing how society should be structured.
11035 11035 It 's gon na happen very f * * * ing soon because [ Noel is ] greedy and he loves money and he knows that it 's got to happen soon or it wo n't happen.
11040 11040 The rankings were largely based on which advertiser would pay them [ Trivago ] the most money,.
11043 11043 The ACCC is concerned there will be limited similar alternatives for brokers to switch to. This may negatively impact the services offered to brokers.
11044 11044 AFG and Connective operate in an already concentrated market, and not many other mortgage aggregators offer a similar level or type of service. Additionally, potential entrants or small players may be deterred from expanding by various barriers, including compliance costs,.
11046 11046 I think I agree with Rod 's point about fairness because when you think about it, that is what responsible business is all about,.
11047 11047 Urban workers stay in cramped living spaces where they are far more likely to spread infections and it could be worse than them going to work,.
11049 11049 For now, there is not much to be optimistic [ about ], and what we can hope is if there 's going to be the right stimulus -- and it has to be something of at least 3 % of GDP -- this is going to be a very severe, but short recession,.
11050 11050 If the Chinese economy were to shrink by 2 % in the first quarter, it would require growth of 8 % in the final three quarters to reach the 6 % annual growth rate that everyone had expected before the virus broke out,.
11058 11058 That is not on the cards. What we are going to do is to ensure the future for the volunteers, the young people. I 'm not going to discuss actual figures at the moment on that basis but I can tell you that if we see a way of helping young people and volunteers, the grassroots, we made it clear we might be prepared to augment funding.
11059 11059 I am proposing to bring in a fairer, more proportionate system which will distinguish between those who may be only slightly in excess of the relevant speed limit and those who are driving well in excess of the maximum legal limit applying.
11068 11068 called for restraint and de-escalation. A new conflict would be in no one 's interest.
11070 11070 the decision of the US, not of the [ anti-Islamic State ( Isis ) ] coalition or of Nato.
11074 11074 A pandemic scenario had been raised as a possibility in previous economic policy discussions, but none of us had a meaningful sense of what it would look like on the ground and what it would mean for the economy. We now encounter a grim reality, where exponential growth of contagion means 100 infected individuals become 10,000 in a matter of a few days,.
11077 11077 As containment measures come off, policies should shift swiftly to supporting demand, incentivizing firm hiring, and repairing balance sheets in the private and public sector to aid the recovery,.
11078 11078 If these tensions return, that will undo all of the improvements in policy uncertainty that we 've seen recently,.
11080 11080 The cumulative loss of global GDP over 2020 and 2021 from the pandemic crisis could be around $ 9 trillion, greater than the economies of Japan and Germany combined,.
11081 11081 Stemming the spread of COVID-19 is of utmost importance. Policies at the moment should focus on both protecting public health and putting people back to work. Getting the virus under control is, if anything, a prerequisite to saving livelihoods,.
11083 11083 And you throw that on top of a market that 's full of anxiety about the potential economic global slowdown due to the virus, which I do n't even think we 've seen yet, and you end up with a perfect storm. That 's what we have in there today.
11088 11088 He has written suicide notes but I think he had no intention of carrying them out,.
11092 11092 We have the flexibility to go further if we need to and I think Canadians should feel comforted in that,.
11093 11093 That is the time when everyone else capitulates and thinks the world will never come back, that 's the time you want to be the buyer, because it will. Stick to your long-term course, and be the buyer when no one else is. If you retain your risk appetite you understand you can still take risk.
11098 11098 Buffett figuratively took her [ CEO Vicki Hollub ] to the cleaners. The Buffett deal was like taking candy from a baby and amazingly she even thanked him publicly for it ! But you ca n't blame Warren, if Hollub was arrogant enough to negotiate a deal with Buffett of this magnitude despite her admittedly limited experience in M & A and the Board was misguided enough to rubber stamp it, then one might say in Warren 's defense that it was almost his fiduciary duty to Berkshire Hathaway to accept it.
11099 11099 Council as a whole should have received this information when we asked for it,.
11105 11105 If it 's happening in the United States, eventually it will come to Canada,.
11109 11109 With the relatively limited space to cut Bank Rate, if evidence builds that the weakness in activity could persist, risk management considerations would favor a relatively prompt response,.
11110 11110 Turner 's art was transformative. I am delighted that the work of arguably the single most influential British artist of all time will now appear on another 2 billion works of art -- the new £ 20 notes that people can start using today.
11115 11115 The spice of life is in taking risks. The desire for security suggests we are still reeling under colonialism preached by the British,.
11117 11117 And they wanted it to be uploaded to the computer. Somebody came from Rajasthan, Barmer ... He said we do n't have electricity, how can we upload ? So I said upload it on your head and go to the Prime Minister and tell him,.
11119 11119 Even before coronavirus hit us, we needed a 10 % + per year growth rate for a decade to wipe out unemployment from the country. Now even if we achieve 10 % + per year growth, it will not be enough to wipe out unemployment within the decade,.
11120 11120 There is certain evidence that I would have liked to have seen led in this trial but, for a variety of reasons, we were not able to do so. Those facts will see the light but it wo n't be this day.
11121 11121 Some people are very clearly very anxious to remove me now as a political threat, which is why this is probably not over,.
11123 11123 It is hard to see how he can continue in his role as dean [ of the Faculty of Advocates ],.
11126 11126 With this knowledge, we can work together to reduce the impact of the pandemic on all Australians,.
11128 11128 he would have been booed if he said anything much about this and I think he was being very careful not to get booed.
11133 11133 A lot of people have been reluctant to use video conferencing tools in the past ; there 's always the thinking that it 's better to do it in person. But many businesses will now realize they can do much more online than they realize -- because, right now, they have to,.
11138 11138 Therefore, I can tell you that the markets are, in my view, very well supplied with oil, and as a result of that, we see prices remain at $ 65 a barrel.
11139 11139 The levels of spending still fall significantly short of what would be needed in the Stated Policies scenario, particularly in the power sector.
11143 11143 People become homeless or are unstably housed, because they can no longer afford housing or can not find affordable housing right. That 's the reason people become homeless.
11145 11145 There is n't much here. Should n't have taken long to negotiate.
11147 11147 Emerging supply chain disruptions and the recent tightening in financial conditions will likely add to the growth hit.
11149 11149 a payroll tax cut makes little sense in this circumstance, because it does nothing for those who ca n't work .... President Trump should shut-the-hell-up.
11150 11150 I continue to believe that a Hispanic from Texas would be optimum. I think Texas is winnable and if it goes blue, the GOP is dead at the presidential level. Put a stake in its heart, Joe.
11152 11152 It 's just conceivable that it could throw the United States into a recession,.
11157 11157 The objective is not and can not be to eliminate the recession altogether,.
11164 11164 This suggests it 's going to be highly disruptive to the economy. A 20 percent decline would not be out of the question ... but that still does n't mean you go out and sell,.
11167 11167 If this is a pandemic and it does come here, I do n't see how we avoid a downturn,.
11168 11168 The firewall has some cracks, but judging by the February employment gain it should be strong enough to weather most scenarios.
11169 11169 The most straightforward, obvious thing would be a payroll tax holiday,.
11170 11170 If it goes to a pandemic, then I think the economy is in recession,.
11181 11181 We do not want to face continued political and economic disintegration. We do not want to reach the tipping point of irreversibility on climate change. And we do not want that the next generation to inherit a world, which becomes ever more hostile and ever less habitable. Just think of the wildfires in Australia,.
11183 11183 It 's a place where you really can talk to the leaders of governments, business and so on, and you 'll find good open ears to listen to you and to act together with you,.
11185 11185 We will see higher default rates and business failures. It could be like the 1930s.
11187 11187 We 're likely to be OK for the next year or so,.
11188 11188 While it is unfortunate that I was unable to go in person to the ED, our senior authorised representative did attend in person with the requisite information. Needless to say, if in the future any assistance or support to the investigation is requested from us, we will cooperate fully,.
11190 11190 Needless to say, if in the future any assistance or support to the investigation is requested from us, we will cooperate fully,.
11193 11193 If opportunistic behaviours develop, the attitude of people who are naturally respectful of injunctions risks evolving in the wrong direction,.
11196 11196 It would enable people to not work, if that 's what they need to do. It will prevent some people from not making their rent payments,.
11199 11199 Once you 've developed a lifestyle based on a certain income, to say that you could live with 20 % less does n't mean you wo n't have to give up a lot,.
11202 11202 We go into real recession if the fiscal response is poor or delayed, the uncertainty about U.S. government ability to manage the virus -- to bend the curve -- remains high, and/or the irrelevant-to-the-health-crisis lashing out of the Trump Administration worsens international commerce,.
11209 11209 The world is getting hotter and climates more variable. And we are seeing that already in Australia, perhaps more than any other place in the world.
11210 11210 As the unemployment rate declines and the labour market tightens, some limited upward pressure on wage outcomes can be expected.
11211 11211 While it 's plausible that we can move toward our goals, at least right at the moment the risks have slightly tilted to outweigh the benefits,.
11214 11214 I would like to see both business and government use the opportunity to make investments,.
11220 11220 Researchers have studied a stark change, the day after daylight saving time, or a week after, but what is so much harder to study is the entire summer or winter,.
11221 11221 that ` we can compete against the best in the world, but we ca n't compete against the central bank of Japan.
11222 11222 I hope to contribute intellectual diversity as a Governor and would work collegially to promote sound money and sound finances,.
11224 11224 There 'll be no shortage of customers. We just need an investor : we have a construction gang and a building site in Mariupol -- we can build a house for free, then sell it and split the profit with the investor.
11225 11225 While growth in the fourth quarter is expected to have picked up, electricity supply constraints will likely keep economic activity muted in the near term. Public sector investment continues to be weak and export growth remains lacklustre, despite strong terms of trade. Government and household consumption, and private investment, continue to grow, albeit modestly.
11228 11228 I think the more attention we give to fringe candidates, the more power we give to them,.
11231 11231 She said sometimes it can be hard to get things like this to the right person,.
11234 11234 If major players like Singapore do not wean themselves away from fossil fuel-based growth, climate change will accelerate and there will no longer be any growth.
11239 11239 It 's like we want Prince Charming on a white horse. We 're taught gender stereotypes : Men are supposed to sweep us off our feet ... But Prince Charming has no horse. We need to walk into our futures on our own two feet.
11240 11240 Under normal circumstances, the two-week delay in agreeing on a response would not be a big deal,.
11241 11241 the adverse market reaction may not be just a market verdict on the ECB 's package ... It could also reflect a growing realization that monetary and fiscal policy can not be the genuine circuit breakers in a medical emergency.
11242 11242 Solid gains in real disposable incomes and still elevated levels of consumer confidence suggest that the data will either be revised up for late 2019 or show a significant snapback for early 2020,.
11251 11251 The extent of that shock still needs to be assessed, but it could provide the spark for an arguably long-overdue adjustment in the capital markets.
11252 11252 What matters most is n't what the Fed has done today, but what actions it signals for the future. A strong commitment by Fed officials to do whatever is needed to accommodate dollar demand, and thereby prevent any persistent decline in overall spending, will ultimately help allay panic more than any single rate cut can.
11253 11253 Workplaces, even those deemed ` essential', should be doing all they can to ensure that their workers are able to work from home or, if they do have to attend work, that they can undertake social distancing.
11254 11254 Like so many I 'm sure right now, I have just been feeling really overwhelmed and scared and life is chaotic, so I was just thinking what I could do to help the nurses and doctors. I know they are so overwhelmed and I thought ` What is something I can do ?' It started with the Chick-fil-a points. We started asking just our staff at church, and then it ran to just our team members and then it just expanded from there and blew up on social media because everybody is looking for a way to help right now,.
11255 11255 You can relax, knowing that you 'll still be able to wipe your bum.
11259 11259 As such, we are delighted to introduce the product our Manchester route. With Qsuite, we have redefined business and luxury travel and we are thrilled to offer our loyal customers this unique product, which is unlike anything they would have experience before.
11260 11260 generous incentives to build an abuse case against the Canadian -- -- Cartier jewellery, a regular salary or a year 's rent in a gated community.
11262 11262 If the participation rate remained as low today as it was four or six years ago, wages probably would have inched up a little faster,.
11264 11264 The reality is that you can not continually go strong,.
11267 11267 However, we must understand that abiding to legal institutional roles and responsibilities is key to building a truly democratic state.
11268 11268 Secondly, we must also not forget that apart from CPEC we also have a Free Trade Agreement ( FTA ) with China, under which some 313 priority based items that Pakistan exports would be zero rated, whereas the rest of items will become zero rated in the coming 10 years,.
11270 11270 Should EU countries also adopt a high carbon tax, we would likely see huge carbon emission reductions throughout the Continent, as we 've seen in Great Britain over the last few years.
11271 11271 Should you buy stocks today, or should you be selling stocks today ?.
11275 11275 However, the outbreak and its effects could be more persistent. Consumer and business confidence could be set back for a longer period of time, causing economic growth to slow more persistently. This could include longer-term layoffs, for example. At this point, we simply do not know.
11277 11277 it seems to be functioning well so far.
11280 11280 In supporting countries to build circularity into their economies, PACE can play a powerful role in advancing the climate, biodiversity and resource efficiency agendas with both scale and speed.
11281 11281 It really could be the worst jobs report we 've ever seen in our history.
11295 11295 The government insists that all is on track, but we all suspect not,.
11298 11298 if we ripped up all the railways in 1890, gross national product [ similar to GDP ] would have been reduced by around 6 %,.
11299 11299 If your money was deposited in something and you saw it losing, for sure, all te time, it would just be painful,.
11304 11304 With both India and Japan as full partners in the BRI, such a pan-Asian grouping could once again recreate a bipolar global order which remains essential to the peace and prosperity of the 21st century.
11310 11310 ! I think you are well orchestrating the compulsion of history and demand of destiny that we and India be the best of friends, joined at the hip and yet as family, free hearts and minds to love across a spectrum of emotions, but always together,.
11314 11314 Therefore, we must be prepared from now,.
11317 11317 and the political support that the provision of these services can command, may depend crucially on the participation of a large part of the population in the benefits of public provisioning.
11319 11319 I knew the only way this joke was really going to work is if I was massive because the bigger he was or the more capable he was of being a beast in the field, the funnier -- I thought -- that he was in the van,.
11320 11320 If you were going to pick one place to win the battle, that 's it,.
11321 11321 is really much closer to a major snowstorm or a natural disaster than it is to a classic 1930s-style depression.
11322 11322 It can be extremely hard to find an appropriate comparison group, especially when you 're looking at extremes, such as these very sick, high cost patients. And this is why you do randomized control trials to ensure a proper comparison group,.
11323 11323 We 're trying to coordinate with other services that might come into play in the very near future. We do n't want to duplicate services. We want to work in the gaps, where people do n't have services, we want to work there.
11325 11325 People come to believe whatever they must believe when they must believe it.
11328 11328 Until we can restore people 's confidence that we have the virus under control ... it 's difficult for me to imagine that economic activity will return to normal.
11329 11329 Credibility is hard to gain, but it is easily lost. To be maintained, it requires continuous vigilance. If lost, it can be regained only at high costs to society,.
11331 11331 We have also submitted a proposal to the local authority to trial a rail seating area within the stadium. Our belief is that the introduction of rail seating would enhance spectator safety in areas of the stadium where, as with other clubs, we have seen examples of persistent standing.
11333 11333 We should n't be focusing solely on the numbers. It 's clear that growth will enter negative territory. We should be looking at the bigger picture. This is n't a typical recession rooted in endogenous macroeconomic factors. It 's a slowdown in activity caused by an external shock. From an economic standpoint, our real priority should be to minimize the long-term consequences.
11334 11334 Hang on to your gold or fixed income instruments or dividend-paying stocks which have low debt ; these would be good bets,.
11338 11338 The election of Donald Trump is understandable in the circumstances, but it is a gesture of frustration and rage that will make things worse, not better. Working-class whites do not believe that democracy can help them ; in 2016, more than two-thirds of white working-class Americans believed that elections are controlled by the rich and by big corporations, so that it does not matter if they vote.
11339 11339 Environmentalism is a strange term. I think it is really about rediscovering your humanity and how your humanity relates to life.
11346 11346 If we had national daily reporting, inpatient admissions and ICU admissions, that would be a great boost for understanding where the next big wave is coming or where we 're really seeing progress.
11348 11348 Their share of this tax will seem like a big number to the corporate media,.
11351 11351 precautionary measures for us to be taking so we can complete our work through the duration of session.
11353 11353 It is really important that we are prepared and so that, in the case, there is an issue with the virus, that we are ready to handle it as we would any other issue.
11357 11357 So we 're reducing the number of calls that we respond to. And when we do respond, we 'll ask the public to step out if that 's appropriate. But in some examples we do have to make physical arrests. When we do, we 'll put on the appropriate equipment to do so and we 're also decontaminating our vehicles after transport.
11359 11359 The same policy choice that helps the central bank attain its inflation target in the short run may be making it more difficult to attain its target in the longer run.
11363 11363 What I do n't know is whether our politics is capable of fixing that.
11367 11367 The Kremlin has decided to sacrifice OPEC + to stop U.S. shale producers and punish the U.S. for messing with Nord Stream 2. Of course, to upset Saudi Arabia could be a risky thing, but this is Russia 's strategy at the moment -- flexible geometry of interests.
11368 11368 What we do n't know yet is whether we 'll be able to bounce back quickly or whether it will linger on for a decade or more .... The greater extent that we can keep workers attached to their firms and keep the firms afloat, the more likely it is it will bounce back quickly.
11374 11374 For what else can be made of a plan that emphasizes that the Palestinian leadership did not reject Rabin 's vision at the time ?.
11375 11375 I can think of one or two students ... in my required first-year course.
11376 11376 Nationally, 50 percent of Lime customers have a payback length of one year or less and 80 percent have a payback of less than two years.
11377 11377 Policies put in place to respond to the crisis must be in collaboration with them ; we must be firm and clear on good governance to safeguard our health systems, ensure proper use of emergency funds, prevent our businesses from collapse, and reduce worker lay-offs.
11380 11380 Think about in the hospitals, all that equipment, everything there 's a program running behind it. You look in the manufacturing plants, we live in Detroit, the assembly line. There 's a program behind it,.
11383 11383 In addition to bold national actions, deeper international cooperation is the most effective vaccine against this virulent threat. Countries in East Asia and the Pacific and elsewhere must fight this disease together, keep trade open and coordinate macroeconomic policy,.
11387 11387 The EU and China both recognise that research and innovation are vital to ensure our future prosperity and to tackle global challenges. Together, we can do this better. That is why we want to step up our cooperation in research and innovation in areas of mutual interest, based on fair framework conditions in the spirit of reciprocity.
11391 11391 If one goes through enough numbers, one will eventually come upon some statistics that seem to fit one 's vision,.
11392 11392 Of course, one can also create a new institution if that is what the member states want. It would take one, two or three years, and member states have to come up with capital or guarantees, or assign future revenue.
11395 11395 And not all of their ideas, in my mind, are completely sane and would make sense for college athletics.
11397 11397 This would be a way to release more liquidity into the system. Another cut is not impossible. Why they want to tighten at this point of time when the economy is not so good. It will worsen the situation,.
11398 11398 I am socially isolating because I lost my regular shift at my ongoing job. I have a car, I do n't have dependants, I have a fully stocked fridge. I am good to go in terms of helping. It seemed something I morally should do.
11400 11400 The only thing to do is how we can help workers to keep up.
11404 11404 Government should also actively seek to restore wetlands that have been lost.
11405 11405 This virus has n't gone away, it 's not going away any time soon. If we were to relax those measures at this time this virus would come back and we would end up being overwhelmed with the impact that it would have.
11406 11406 I think it is quite possible that the economy 's growth rate for the full year will be substantially lower,.
11408 11408 We should have done something in early January, but for two-and-a-half months we were in self denial,.
11409 11409 Coding stuff, even small things, can help you automate stuff for data processing, different projects at school ( and ) a lot of applications. Hopefully it becomes useful and maybe ( turns into ) a career.
11410 11410 And we can strive to be a lot more if we get generations to start coding here.
11411 11411 One day someone posted on social media that they are dropping the kid off at a coder school in Atlanta and we thought what is this ? We were really intrigued,.
11415 11415 In the end, our answers to this crisis will not come from one method, one region, or one country in isolation,.
11416 11416 WHO is there to protect the health of people, and the IMF, to protect the health of the economy. Saving lives and protecting livelihoods ought to go hand in hand.
11420 11420 is emerging consensus that existing SDRs could be used.
11422 11422 For China, the Year of the Rat has begun with a challenging start as the country is battling the coronavirus outbreak. On behalf of all IMF members, employees, and management, I would like to express our deep sympathies to those affected by the serious situation related to the coronavirus,.
11426 11426 The CCRT can provide about $ 500 million in grant-based debt service relief, including the recent $ 185 million pledge by the United Kingdom and $ 100 million provided by Japan as immediately available resources,.
11428 11428 It is tough as it is. Let 's not make it any tougher ... My advice would be to seek ways in which this element of uncertainty is reduced in the interests of everybody, of the UK, of the EU, the whole world.
11433 11433 For some people, [ using ROBS ] delays a sedentary retirement, but other people may lose a lot of capital,.
11436 11436 Health care workers who have had close contact with a confirmed case of Covid-19 and have not developed symptoms, and are deemed to be essential workers, may work, provided they observe strict adherence to infection prevention and control precautions, and undergo twice daily active monitoring by occupational health, for 14 days after contact with a confirmed case of Covid-19.
11439 11439 We can move from 70 to 30 to 10 homicides by scaling up the work and shifting our investments into jobs, housing and healing services.
11441 11441 Since it is already March, these factors could easily affect the second quarter,.
11442 11442 designed to expand or not,.
11443 11443 I suspect he 's going to leave it for his replacement, whoever that is.
11444 11444 In this case, the central bank would provide collateralized funding at a subsidized rate as long as banks met specified lending objectives.
11445 11445 Since receiving treatment I have been able to sleep. I have been able to return to playing sport and most importantly I have = been able to enjoy family activities and interact with my daughter the way a parent should without the restriction of so much pain.
11447 11447 However, with this growing platform, we can help the NHS even more. Therefore, as entry to this quiz, I ask that you donate £ 2 ( £ 2 is the minimum donation amount on JustGiving ) and all proceeds will be donated to the NHS to help in this difficult time.
11449 11449 can be reopened carefully as China has so far successfully done.
11452 11452 Unemployment is low, but will begin to rise if job growth slows much further,.
11453 11453 That would probably be half the impact of the 737 Max,.
11454 11454 We all pay payroll taxes. We could not pay them for awhile, [ and ] that would be a cash infusion, particularly to low-middle income households, and they would spend that very quickly.
11461 11461 Can you try to be sexier ? Maybe more likable this time ?.
11463 11463 I thought it was normal to feel like you 're going to pass out afterward,.
11467 11467 If we 'd had paid leave going into this, we 'd be less concerned about the spread of the virus and less concerned about its impact on families,.
11469 11469 I would never, under any circumstances, be touching ( the complainer ) inappropriately.
11470 11470 I did n't really have time to stop and think about it. I had work to do.
11473 11473 There was no indication to me that it was wrong. She told me not to be daft.
11475 11475 He 'll certainly re-join the party and will want to stand in the Holyrood elections next year. I do n't think he 'll make a play to be first minister but I do think he will try to complicate Nicola 's efforts to carry on.
11477 11477 I felt like every time I managed to get a hand off, another hand would appear. He was very persistent and I felt like I was wrestling with an octopus. It just felt like hands, another hand, coming on to my wrist.
11478 11478 It contains a risk of a backlash in popular opinion in Southern Europe against the North which could significantly complicate future cooperation within the EU-Eurozone.
11479 11479 Of course, a hypothetical central bank promise to buy almost unlimited amounts of equities and thus turn itself into a potential majority owner of a country 's productive capital could end the equity selloff. But we do not expect policy makers to go for this hypothetical variant of ` whatever it takes',.
11483 11483 T he value of individual responsibility -- which conservatives rightly prize and which everybody else should prize more -- it just does n't apply now,.
11484 11484 All Americans should demand that the coronavirus outbreak be regarded by Washington as the most urgent possible wake-up call,.
11487 11487 Either the cup is half full or half empty. To us, that is a $ 68 - $ 108 billion opportunity.
11489 11489 Africa is facing enormous fiscal challenges to respond to the coronavirus pandemic effectively. The African Development Bank Group is deploying its full weight of emergency response support to assist Africa at this critical time. We must protect lives. This Facility will help African countries to fast-track their efforts to contain the rapid spread of COVID-19,.
11491 11491 Either the cup is half empty or half full. To us, that is a $ 68-billion to $ 108-billion opportunity.
11495 11495 It ought to be in every company and stakeholder 's interest to make sure that the planet they live on will thrive,.
11500 11500 we should be providing some stimulus to bring UK economy back to trend rate of growth,.
11501 11501 In my view, these should be resisted,.
11507 11507 At our meeting today, Allies called for restraint and de-escalation. A new conflict would be in no-one 's interest, so Iran must refrain from further violence and provocations.
11513 11513 Every carmaker ? Every region in the world ? I do n't think that has ever happened.
11515 11515 I suppose we must prepare ourselves for an attack by government ministers on the IMF and Dr Gita Gopinath,.
11517 11517 Countries need to co-operate on multiple fronts to lift growth and spread prosperity ... They must adopt strategies to limit the rise in global temperatures and the severe consequences of weather-related natural disasters.
11521 11521 I can see people very easily switching from paying in cash to paying using a digital payment platform. But whether they will as easily switch from the dollar to the renminbi that is a completely different question,.
11525 11525 Putin could still change his mind,.
11528 11528 We tell them, ` You 're not going to get sick, and we 're young. If we get it, we 're going to be OK, but a lot of other people are n't, and we have a responsibility to stop the spread of this disease. That means you eliminate any contact you can eliminate.'.
11537 11537 There are proposals to use the European Stability Mechanism or the European Investment Bank. The issuance of one-off ` corona bonds' would also be conceivable. It is up to politicians to decide,.
11539 11539 Transparent and honest entrepreneurs should not be suspicious, and we have wanted to move together with those entrepreneurs. In the act of revenue leakage there is fine of Rs 5 million and jail for three years.
11540 11540 And I think that 's so cool, that a republican governor wanted to do whatever he could to work with a democratic governor in Cuomo. And in this time, this transcends politics and brings everything together,.
11544 11544 She thought it was a bold and dangerous piece and she loved it. She saw what the piece was about and how timely it was and how confrontational it was in all the right ways.
11545 11545 You think he 's Shylock Holmes, Jew Detective ?.
11549 11549 Africa may lose half of its GDP with growth falling from 3.2 per cent to about 2 per cent due to a number of reasons which include the disruption of global supply chains,.
11550 11550 This will enable countries to focus on prevention as much as possible and start building curative facilities. Support should be provided to WHO and CDC Africa with funds channeled through the Global Fund, GAVI and others,.
11551 11551 However, for legal reasons, we have no option but to seek to protect our interests, dispel the ongoing confusion and avoid any potential damage to our reputation. We are hopeful this can be easily resolved with a name change. Any continued usage by the Blockchain will only evidence an intentionally predatory, misleading and fraudulent strategy.
11552 11552 We could see very attractive revenue and cash flow from gold mining stocks this quarter,.
11553 11553 In other cultures, they would have the dignity to resign or worse,.
11555 11555 You should n't take much from that. They 're just saying with the coronavirus and all that going on, they do n't want to go on a roadshow now to go visit people all over the country to talk about the deal when everyone understands the deal already. This is a great deal.
11564 11564 This work shows the power of data and is a good example of how it can benefit everyone,.
11566 11566 Sudan 's foreign affairs must be made by the Council of Ministers,.
11569 11569 We have recorded a lot of surplus under the Transitional Stabilisation Programme, but have invited a lot of debate. First part of the TSP was accounted with austerity and the stage is now behind us. This year, we should see stabilisation in the economy as we have planned,.
11570 11570 Well, it is part of the negotiations as you know, but we will do everything within our means as Government. I am sure we can agree on something that all parties will be happy about and we are determined to do that.
11576 11576 So the challenge for the government right now is to get through the virus and not emerge on the other side with unemployment in double digits. We already know GDP growth will be negative but we can still keep it from being minus 10 % and try to keep it at maybe minus 2 % instead. This ` hibernation' phase is really just to minimise the downside risk.
11581 11581 The Australian government has created the Emission Reduction Fund to provide businesses with the opportunity to earn Australian carbon credit units for every tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent a business stores or avoids emitting through adopting new practices and technologies. In the private sector, a United States-based start-up is also offering financial incentives of US $ 15 per tonne of carbon dioxide sequestered,.
11585 11585 Fortunately, more countries recognize that their economies can only reach their full potential with full participation of both women and men. We are focusing on helping countries achieve good development outcomes.
11593 11593 Yeah, in the knowledge of no other conversations, I 'd assume that that was, yeah, certainly the position I was putting. Chest beating. I think I used the word but I ca n't recall.
11594 11594 Failure by any business to honour its cancellations or refunds policy may constitute misleading conduct under the Australian Consumer Law,.
11599 11599 A lot of people see $ 100 as the GDP slowing level around the world, and a lot of the estimates I 've seen say if you disrupt some of the flow through the Straits of Hormuz you 're going to see $ 75 oil, not $ 100 oil.
11601 11601 The first thing I did was to take the text across to the Prime Minister 's suite because I wanted him to hear about it first from me. He read it in silence and, at first, made no comment. Then, he suddenly asked me whether I thought he should resign,.
11602 11602 if firms sever their connections to their workers,.
11606 11606 That might scare the market instead, which happened to Wall Street after the US Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to nearly zero in two surprise cuts this month,.
11613 11613 If someone is tempted to use the noise around the coronavirus to solve their current problems by firing staff, such enterprises will be visited by the labor inspection, federal tax service and the prosecutor 's office,.
11622 11622 Usually by the end of November, nothing new is going to come out, so if you come out in January, you 're satisfying six to seven weeks of [ pent-up ] demand.
11623 11623 Okay, we 'll give them that -- because this is actually how risk mitigation is supposed to work. In that, hedge funds represented a risk mitigation cost to portfolios when the markets were n't plunging -- sort of like paying an insurance premium.
11624 11624 Whether we call this ` crash-alpha' or ` crash-beta,' outside of what they did from 2000-2002, none of our hedge-fund indices moved the needle through any observable edge,.
11625 11625 the ( Trudeau ) government 's commitment to maintaining or reducing the country 's relative debt to the size of the economy ( did n't ) seem all that strong, since the ratio actually increased between 2018-19 and 2019-20 ... the Parliamentary Budget Office recently estimated that the debt-to-GDP ratio will now rise to 38.1 %, before accounting for much of the government 's fiscal response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
11627 11627 I think it stresses the importance of worship in Catholic life,.
11628 11628 If Chinese manufacturing comes back, who exactly are they selling to ?.
11630 11630 My client conversations are all about, ` is this the black swan ? Is this what can derail the global expansion ?.
11631 11631 For all practical purposes, the U.S. economy is closed, so why would you expect layoffs to stop ?.
11632 11632 Now, due to the coronavirus we may very well see further downward pressure on oil prices,.
11638 11638 This situation seems to have no equal in oil market history,.
11645 11645 But with higher temperatures and more variable conditions the patterns we have always seen are going to be amplified probably and we need to prepare for that.
11646 11646 If that occurs, this could increase the risk of problems down the track. So there is a balance to be struck here.
11652 11652 Think of the current bureaucratic waste that would be saved. No more calendar committees figuring out when breaks, terms and exams would take place.
11653 11653 Because the problem-solvers need to get together with those having problems. They should tell about their problems so others can find a solution. This did not happen, but I hope it will,.
11654 11654 Do it because you love Star Wars ... or just to annoy people,.
11655 11655 It will be hard to lock down the country entirely for much longer periods, so we should also be thinking of how we can restart certain activities in certain low-infection regions with adequate precautions,.
11656 11656 There are thousands of commercial buildings in Central New York and we are working actively with our five member counties to implement an open CPACE financing, so that other property developers like Mr. Riley can have the same opportunities but it takes those visionaries to step up to the plate.
11661 11661 The Law Commission then went on to say that the way forward may not be a Uniform Civil Code but codification of all personal laws so that prejudices and stereotypes in every one of them will come to law and could be tested on the anvil of fundamental rights,.
11662 11662 Sanskrit has always been the monopoly of a few and that is a matter of great sadness and tragedy for India. We have to make this monopoly of the few into the treasure of the many. And, that is what this Bill should hope to accomplish,.
11664 11664 Where can we get creative and use the tools we have to interact with people ?.
11669 11669 I think it 's easy to jump on the bandwagon and say how bad the market is,.
11673 11673 Watching very carefully seems to be the mantra of the moment. I do n't think they are going to do anything yet, but I tell you if we have a few more days like yesterday, they probably would,.
11674 11674 The infrastructure of the oil sector, though, is a likely target in the event of tit-for-tat escalation.
11677 11677 If Bernie Sanders becomes president, I think stock prices should be 30 % to 40 % lower than they are now,.
11682 11682 The work force should be protected. We 've had discussions with their reps and we are determined there will be no compulsory redundancies,.
11685 11685 There has to be a semblance of convergence of our manifestos. If not, the alliance will collapse,.
11687 11687 If something happens to that border, it will be a completely different situation,.
11690 11690 It 's nice to connect with consumers and get them to think about their relationship with food.
11692 11692 co-ordinated policy actions across all the major economies would be needed to ensure effective healthcare provision around the world and provide the most effective stimulus to the global economy.
11694 11694 I think by the time we get to Easter we are going to probably see about 1.5 to 1.8 million job losses due to stand downs,.
11702 11702 Sorry to everybody who came to the gig tonight in Hamburg. My voice was not there and if I 'd have carried on I 'd have done more damage to it. I love you all and hope you understand. I 'll make it up to you.
11705 11705 Today CJI in Supreme Court directed the government to file a counter to my affidavit demanding designation of Rama Setu as Ancient Heritage Monument and said due to the heavy load of the Court, CJI Bench will hear my WP three months. Hence, I hope GOI will no more delay or waffle on this and file.
11706 11706 Gorkhaland is top priority. Must make it a Union Territory as promised.
11708 11708 we may thus win the coronavirus battle but be badly defeated by the war to save the economy from collapse.
11709 11709 BRI has large advantages that India must enjoy and if the Chinese are willing to accommodate this and not go through parts of Kashmir, we will be in a position to gain in terms of international trade and bilateral relations,.
11711 11711 we should not be afraid of foreign competition. We should take on the foreign competition head on in the global markets. If we are not doing that, something is very wrong,.
11715 11715 If Congress does n't understand that we 're looking at maybe one of the worst jobs numbers we 've ever seen, and we 're looking at a negative GDP number in the second quarter that 's really large, if they do n't understand that, then they can not do a stimulus for sure,.
11719 11719 One of the things that we would do is we would go back to our variety of stakeholders, whether it 's from the residential, from the educational, from the staff perspective, share what we had learned, understand what their perspectives were, what questions needed to be addressed, what were the ideas they had for addressing certain concerns, and then that itself would become the input for subsequent phone calls,.
11720 11720 Sport is a great way to bring people together, whether it 's played in Shanghai or Docklands.
11722 11722 But having said that, I recognise the situation is extremely dynamic and to some extent there are matters that are out of control. There are decisions made by the ( government ) or might be made overseas.
11725 11725 suggests that stakeholder capitalism might be accelerated. But the results will depend on leadership from both companies and government officials,.
11726 11726 the Soleimani episode ought to prompt Pyongyang to re-examine its assumptions about U.S. behavior,.
11731 11731 It 's so important to create environments where those struggling with life can be helped to find peace and calm. All of us have the right to be protected from harm and the right to feel safe.
11732 11732 My largest positions are not the ones I think I 'm going to make the most money from. My largest positions are the ones I do n't think I 'm going to lose money in.
11733 11733 People say if you start questioning the number of zeros in the billionaire 's fortune ... where are you going to stop ?.
11737 11737 To reform the healthcare system required a tremendous amount of political determination and willingness to pay a political price. Chinese top leaders seem to be willing to do that. However, it is slower than some of us like to see.
11738 11738 We are delighted to have TCL once again as our partner and we would look forward to taking this partnership to great new heights. Our aim has always been to provide our sponsors with the best mileage for their brand and create a prominent position for them on all fronts.
11739 11739 I think that when we look back at this episode, we will conclude that March 2020 was already a recession month,.
11740 11740 MOB is therefore ` subconcussive.' A service member would likely notice the exposure. However, they may not think of MOB as a potential health hazard.
11741 11741 None of the patients had complications that you might normally see from donor cells and the results were as good as you 'd get from a donor transplant -- or better,.
11742 11742 They know the Fed is on the job. If there are issues that come up, what you 're seeing from this Federal Reserve is : ` We will deal with it.'.
11743 11743 The agencies would n't want to be putting their staff at risk.
11744 11744 The club continues to enjoy a good relationship with Matt. He has many friends here and the overwhelmingly positive feedback we received when we announced that he would return in 2020 is a measure of Matt himself : he 's a fantastic person on and off the cricket field,.
11749 11749 We need to find a solution because classes can not resume if they are still there,.
11751 11751 simplified communication may, alone, be necessary but not sufficient.
11753 11753 The feds have been taking pretty aggressive actions to try and prevent the markets from seizing up, and so far it seems to be working.
11754 11754 We 're trying to accommodate the agricultural world too, and their concerns if somebody should become ill that 's part of their H-2A labor force.
11760 11760 From what the Minister [ Trades and Industry Ministry ] said, I do n't believe that all 275 factories will be ready. Keep in mind that it is not the government that is producing the factories. It is the private sector and you can not force them to produce the factories,.
11761 11761 If what we produce is classified it 's not much use to police or fire fighters. We 've learned that the hard way.
11763 11763 receive end-of-life care in the community, which would be more efficient, timely, and less burdensome.
11766 11766 We want to know whether you have committed the money as was directed by the president and for what purpose,.
11768 11768 Alarmist numbers based on questionable assumptions should not be used to prolong the lockdown, at least in its present form,.
11772 11772 Back in the day I used to just try to kill myself with these workouts, but now I 'm trying to just get to the gym every single day, and maybe one or to days off on the weekends.
11776 11776 We now have testing kiosks, which are being used for sample collection. We have a shielded cabin for health workers, where people can come and get tested if they show symptoms. These kiosks are going to be placed at district borders,.
11778 11778 What 's hard for socio-economists to quantify is the potential demand for rental. How many people living in households with roommates, or living in the parental home, or living in other cities, who would form a new rental household in this region if they could find one available within their budget ? There is a lot of pent-up demand out there. All of those condo units that came on stream in 2019 found tenants, the vacancy rate did not improve.
11780 11780 giving me elements of understanding racecraft, pressure, not making mistakes, and driving techniques. When I got into the actual racing it was literally a tool for me to learn the track. When I got there the first time I could apply what I learnt right away.
11781 11781 I think you could easily say that within 10 years, the natural progress of demographics will see the younger core vote who are more solidly pro-independence move into a majority as the older [ more anti-independence ] generation dies off,.
11782 11782 Does she need another mandate ? She 's got one already. Is it simply about the internal politics of the SNP ? Is she trying to play to her flank that wants a referendum ? If she is, she 's wrong. Because not even people like Joanna Cherry think really there is going to be a referendum this year.
11783 11783 If we just close down the damn country ... we might get in front of this and stop it, in which case that short-term panic will lead to a collective sigh of relief,.
11792 11792 But this will likely only happen when the palladium shortages become severe enough to create problems in producing a car, which is still a ways away.
11798 11798 He would be crazy to lose you.
11799 11799 The Civil Rights movement ca n't be built on lies. If you want to make a real moral argument that has political effect in this country, you ca n't base it upon hoaxes, lies, and ruses.
11801 11801 hardly going to restaurants, cinemas, or theaters,.
11803 11803 impact on society might be as profound as that which followed the Black Death in Europe in 1348. That plague caused a fundamental transformation of socio-economic relations in Europe.
11804 11804 In stadiums, big exhibition halls, wherever you can. It seems extreme. It works.
11806 11806 I could n't do it this morning. I could n't get on that train knowing that I might be spending the next three hours trapped in a metal tube with hundreds of furious people.
11807 11807 If you are going to bail them out, wipe out shareholders. Or give the government, on behalf of the American people, some stake in the upside, [ and ] massively restrict payouts and dividends in the future.
11810 11810 That lets you say, ` Instead of the Fed doing what it actually did, suppose it did more or suppose it did less -- or suppose it acted at a different time',.
11811 11811 The creation of a third equal competitor, the combined Sprint-T-Mobile, would have about 30 % of the market, too. This might actually provide a more viable alternative, and a counterweight, to Verizon and AT & T nationwide.
11813 11813 There 's a potential set of people who may not have actually taken the leap to ordering their food from a restaurant through a platform or ordering a meal kit, and they are doing that now because of the quarantine. And so this may change their behaviors even post-quarantine as they 've gotten used to a new way of getting their food delivered,.
11815 11815 Globalization has been hugely beneficial to all of us, simply because of specialization and the comparative advantages of individual locations across the world. That force remains strong and true in the future. However, there is a broader question about the resilience of supply chains ; how can we make sure that supply disruptions do n't make us vulnerable to the entire chain falling apart ?.
11820 11820 Starving people, after all, have little to lose. We need to do what it takes to reassure people that the society does care and that their minimum well-being should be secure,.
11822 11822 suggest that over the next decade, many investors may struggle to meet return objectives anchored to a rosier past,.
11824 11824 Despite subsidies of about $ 10,000 per car, battery-powered electric cars represent less than one-third of 1 % of the world 's 1 billion vehicles. The IEA estimates that with sustained political pressure and subsidies, electric cars could account for 15 % of the much larger global fleet in 2040, but it notes that this increase in share will reduce global CO2 emissions by just 1 %.
11825 11825 Despite the high level of uncertainty, the best scientific advice today suggests that action to mitigate and adapt to climate change is needed.
11828 11828 To the extent that extreme weather events are more frequent or more extreme, that does need to be factored into the way we assess whether banks have adequate capital,.
11829 11829 While we are not out of the woods regarding NPLs, there is still the matter of the lawsuit brought against the government by civil servants which may see the state having to dish out a € 1 bln in back payments.
11830 11830 Once Adele and I recovered from the virus ourselves, it just seemed obvious that we should try to contribute to this effort.
11833 11833 We are moving toward a cashless economy, and technology allows us to pay in very easy ways, going beyond even using credit cards or using traditional bank accounts,.
11834 11834 You should still care about the public health impact, and not covering undocumented immigrants is a really dumb thing to do from a public health perspective.
11835 11835 When you 're just one worker going up against a corporation, you do n't have the leverage you do if you 're part of a unionized workforce.
11841 11841 If we let the epidemic spiral out of control, the economic fallout could be worse,.
11843 11843 There has to be a more direct payment going to the people being affected -- some kind of wage subsidy arrangement. These people should n't have to rely on the goodwill of employers to keep them going or on their retirement savings,.
11844 11844 We have also seen a spike in interest from completely new customers, so we think that this will open up new markets for us as well.
11847 11847 I think you owe the public an explanation of why you 're voting ` no' on the resolution,.
11851 11851 The weather did not help me at all and that is the reason I could not sign and stay at Tusker.
11853 11853 I think ( the coronavirus ) has the potential to be material in the short-to-medium term,.
11854 11854 I think people have to keep in mind, this will come to an end, the question is when this crisis will come to an end, not if it will come to an end.
11855 11855 showed a well-organized approach, with new tools and more sophistication for coordinated attacks. In generating fake news and misinformation on specific targets, these suggested they were not the work of Chinese trolls or individual netizens, but indicated a deployment of China 's cyberarmy units,.
11856 11856 Stock markets sold off double digits. If you look at the escalation of the reported cases, it feels a lot like that.
11859 11859 This time around even the financial sector may be affected, and I doubt protests will calm down.
11861 11861 We fully support EMR 's proposals to introduce express services, which are vital to encourage more passengers to travel to the airport by rail. I look forward to working with Abellio as the new franchise operators throughout their franchise term, to see how we can further enhance the service with more trains and direct access to major cities in the north.
11865 11865 We should understand a little bit more about where the health risk is and where the economic cost is greatest,.
11868 11868 Over a short period, this is likely to be far nastier than a typical recession,.
11869 11869 Dealing with such risks solely through macroprudential policy is challenging. The effectiveness of macroprudential policies is curtailed by the presence of foreign banks and non-bank financial firms lending to households. Moreover, borrower-based measures can exacerbate the impact on inequality arising from housing shortages and housing price appreciation. In such a situation, it is preferable for monetary policy to incorporate financial stability concerns into its policy deliberations. This is something that has long been recognised in our two-pillar strategy, which we would be well advised to maintain if not enhance.
11870 11870 I do n't need eight or 10 refrigerators.
11873 11873 The Trump campaign seems overconfident,.
11877 11877 Like the health experts, bank supervisors are responding to a fast-moving and extraordinary situation. Supervisors must combine the tools from their playbooks for dealing with natural disasters, operational risk events, and bank stress episodes. With its global vantage point, and drawing from past experience, the IMF can offer some additional guidance on the way forward,.
11878 11878 our senior authorised representative did attend in person with the requisite information. Needless to say, if in the future any assistance or support to the investigation is requested from us, we will cooperate fully.
11880 11880 What we know is that despite the positive examples that we have seen over and over, we have far too many schools where the zip code, the race or an individual 's tax bracket determine a child 's life outcome,.
11882 11882 revolutionising how decision-makers would come to view the natural world.
11883 11883 You do n't have to be an environmentalist to care about protecting the environment. Just ask a farmer who now must rent beehives to pollinate his crops, because there are no longer enough bees in wild nature to do the job for free. But bees do n't send invoices, so the value of their services is not recognised,.
11887 11887 Line 3 in Minnesota and the proposed oilsands Teck mine in Alberta reflect the craziness of Canada and the US at the end of the fossil fuel era. Big companies like Enbridge are proposing projects which are not sustainable, and the big new tar sands projects which would fill this line with oil are being closed down,.
11892 11892 statistical analysis shows that it was predictable that Morales would obtain a first-round win, based on the results of the first 83.85 per cent of votes in a rapid count that showed Morales leading runner-up Carlos Mesa by less than 10 points.
11895 11895 He does n't want to do it because companies will make more money if they gouge prices than if the government is taking over. You 're going to produce these masks or respirators and will pay you the cost plus 10 percent -- that 's less money for them. There 's no reason why Congress ca n't put the orders in the legislation.
11903 11903 But even with extremely low growth, inflation does not appear to be slowing further, and we see almost no risk of inflation missing our target from below, which has been a problem for many other countries.
11911 11911 Today ( Monday ) and tomorrow is still the green light but as we 've seen in other parts of the economy, this thing is very changeable ... We 're changing every few days. Enjoy it while we can.
11912 11912 I think that 's why the market is responding the way it is right now to the Federal Reserve 's action,.
11913 11913 If we do, we can expect the same outcome. If it lingers into summer, it 'll be a recession.
11914 11914 And our models then work the way we said they would work.
11915 11915 I would like to think that it passes, but it 's open for a vote,.
11916 11916 We started talking to some of the network people : ` It would be kind of crazy to go test this out. Maybe we could do a special or something on this.' As things started unfolding, it was like, ` This would be a really good spinoff show.' It was definitely a learning experience, trying to figure out why he went over there. I think I got a pretty good idea of what the old man was up to.
11919 11919 My mother was so overcome with grief and shame and anger that she threatened to kill herself if I did not end it .... I took her on face value and ended it ( the relationship ). As a result, I just shut down a part of myself for years ... that needed to be expressed in order to be my full self.
11924 11924 The goal is to provide fast, effective action that responds to country needs. It should recognize the extra burden on poorer countries and also the benefit on global public goods from a comprehensive response worldwide by reducing the spread of pathogens,.
11928 11928 That looks to me like it 's the only real option at the moment. So I think what we 're now doing is a kind of a mating dance with a result - which looks like it 's going to be a Fianna Fáil / Fine Gael coalition,.
11929 11929 We can do this by slowing down, not driving while impaired through drink, drugs or fatigue, by not driving while using a phone, by wearing a seatbelt and always sharing the road more carefully with pedestrians and cyclists.
11933 11933 I do n't think that climate policy should be run by stealth though capital ratios or other use of prudential policy to shift incentives,.
11938 11938 further climate disclosures and climate risk assessments from global banks could increase scrutiny of investments in the Canadian oilsands and nascent liquefied natural gas sector,.
11939 11939 if we handle it well,.
11950 11950 dies if we minimize transmission,.
11957 11957 easily be 20 percent or higher.
11964 11964 This is likely to remain the case for some time yet as efforts continue to contain the virus.
11966 11966 We have seen very weak liquidity conditions so far but we have n't judged them sufficiently poor that we wanted to enter the market. We are prepared to if liquidity conditions deteriorate.
11968 11968 If there 's not too much damage done to the workforce, to the businesses during the shutdown period, however long that may be, then we could see a fairly quick rebound,.
11969 11969 not too much damage [ is ] done to [ our ] workforce and businesses during [ this ] shutdown, we could see a fairly quick rebound. Much closer to a major snowstorm.
11970 11970 Nothing is going to work, the Fed is not going help, fiscal policy is not going to help if we do n't get the public health right, if we do n't solve the problem of the virus, of the infection, so making sure that the risk has declined sufficiently before [ putting ] people back in the line of fire,.
11972 11972 Governments can use the current situation to step up their climate ambitions and launch sustainable stimulus packages focused on clean energy technologies. The coronavirus crisis is already doing significant damage around the world. Rather than compounding the tragedy by allowing it to hinder clean energy transitions, we need to seize the opportunity to help accelerate them,.
11973 11973 if they insist on continuing an oil price war.
11975 11975 The volatility we are seeing in oil markets is detrimental to the global economy at a time that we can least afford it.
11976 11976 Our collective opinion is that children in the 2019/20 cohort should be award GCSEs based upon their predicted grades. This has the obvious advantage of being relatively cheap and easy to do. Weighing up the different options this seems to be as fair as the alternatives.
11978 11978 The person-to-person contact can be much more effective than a letter in the mail,.
11981 11981 In January, when I saw this coronavirus going nuts in China, I was thinking that this is going to be huge here and we 're behind the curve and it 's going to happen,.
11983 11983 A more realistic target would be to try to reach a growth rate of around 8 per cent per year as quickly as possible. This is certainly necessary if we want to continue to reduce poverty and generate the employment needed to satisfy our young and aspirational labour force. Is 8 per cent growth feasible ? India did achieve GDP growth of 8.5 per cent in the first seven years of the UPA, but a return to that growth rate is easier said than done,.
11986 11986 In a democratic society, where dissent can not be suppressed, it becomes necessary to listen to voices of protest and try to carry everyone along. India is much admired for its adherence to democratic norms and this reputation needs to be preserved,.
11987 11987 A swollen money supply presented a grave inflationary threat to the economy. There was a need to bring this money supply under control if the disastrous effects of a sharp price rise were to be avoided,.
11991 11991 Kenney in particular should be politically shunned for his incredible decision to attack Alberta 's doctors and rip up their employment contracts ( alongside his other attacks on public health workers ) just as we ask them to risk their lives, to save ours,.
11994 11994 Broader monetary stimulus such as interest-rate cuts or asset purchases can boost confidence and support financial markets if theres a risk of a significant tightening in financial conditions,.
11995 11995 Worse growth outcomes are possible and even likely.
11998 11998 We model how a cyber-attack may be amplified through the U.S. financial system, focusing on the wholesale payments network,.
12001 12001 At that point, debt would be higher as a percentage of GDP than at any point since since just after World War II and more than double what it has averaged over the past 50 years,.
12005 12005 It 's a worry, particularly more so in America, where there are many more of them and also they wo n't go to hospitals. At least in this country they might be prepared to go to the NHS.
12011 12011 Many here today may disagree with our judgment calls,.
12012 12012 search engines should be proactive in identifying and preventing piracy on their platforms.
12013 12013 The significant declines in the circulation and revenue experienced by many magazines are sustained, substantial and likely to continue, resulting in less investment in content and fewer retail promotions,.
12014 12014 We 're really fed up with these comparison sites misleading consumers and consumers thinking they 're getting a better deal than they in fact are.
12015 12015 We may not know when the gains from Consumer Data Right will kick in, but we can be certain they will be profound. Competition, consumers, and the economy will be benefit considerably,.
12018 12018 Then you 'd probably ask some other logical questions like : ` What are the other houses on the block going for ? And the block next door ? And the town next door ? How relatively cheap is this house relative to other similar houses ?'.
12019 12019 I thought everything that I read in the article made sense to me -- a formula to pick stocks sounded really good to me as well.
12020 12020 We are gradually reopening our retail stores and will continue to do so as steadily and safely as we can.
12023 12023 We do expect it to be quite deep and we are very much urging countries to step up containment measures aggressively so we can shorten the duration of this period of time when the economy is in standstill,.
12027 12027 If we did n't have this synchronized monetary policy, growth would have been in the zone that, by IMF assessment, lingers into recession,.
12034 12034 But we are not excluding that it might turn to be a different scenario like a U curve where the impact is somewhat longer,.
12035 12035 Global cooperation is essential to the containment of the Covid-19 and its economic impact, particularly if the outbreak turns out to be more persistent and widespread.
12040 12040 The crisis in Italy has also rekindled fears about a breakup of the single currency. In an environment with at least a residual focus on self-imposed constraints such as EU budget rules and ECB issuer limits, these fears could well grow further in coming weeks. But if the Euro area decided to view itself as an economic nation state -- at least for the time of the outbreak and its aftermath -- it would actually be in quite a strong position,.
12046 12046 I do n't think at this point that anyone thinks the overall economic effect will be large, but for some industries there will be a noticeable impact,.
12050 12050 Some of our exercises have been modified or cancelled ... but our forces remain ready,.
12052 12052 look into what can be done to provide more support and to speed up the support we provide.
12058 12058 Can we freeze their assets and ban their visas ?.
12066 12066 Like many of my colleagues and so many Americans, I hope that, after last night 's strike, we may finally be on a trajectory of de-escalation with Iran -- after a week that saw tensions come far too close to boiling over. But when it comes to actions that could put the lives of our men and women in uniform at risk, it is crucial that we are dealing in fact.
12068 12068 Having said that, though, if we 're evaluating the new NAFTA as a trade agreement -- which it is -- and we consider the new environmental enforcement tools that Democrats fought hard to include, this new NAFTA can work,.
12072 12072 We could partially exit the lockdown, but if the population has little immunity and the rest of the world is the same, we could face a new wave of virus infections and a new period of lockdowns,.
12074 12074 having two thousand dollars or thereabouts set aside in an emergency fund is a good, at least, first target if you do n't have a fully topped-up emergency fund,.
12075 12075 Some researchers have noted that some people will initiate conversations after reading a book or watching a movie together that includes a family death as a springboard to a conversation,.
12076 12076 I share a room with two other people. The next room has four people, another room has a family. We all share one bathroom and a kitchen. We all try our best to maintain distance and cleanliness but it is difficult, as you can imagine.
12077 12077 I would never go negative, I 'm adverse to that idea,.
12079 12079 Now the bank 's non-performing loans stood at 38 % at the end of December. The bank 's credit should be riskless,.
12083 12083 People only think about the stock market, but we face risk in every part of our life : What is the probability a car breaks down ? Risk and risk management is not just about investing but unexpected things,.

12088 12088 I can hardly talk about it. I 'm voting for them.
12090 12090 I do n't think we need Chinese support of any kind for our healthcare ... Even if Indian firms produce at a higher cost, it does n't matter,.
12098 12098 That is me being kind I can be a lot worse.
12105 12105 signing up for a newsletter or scheduling an appointment or downloading an app or booking a trip.
12108 12108 Calling for low interest rates would make him popular, and he understood low interest rate policies by the Fed would provide more stimulus,.
12110 12110 I think the good ideas that Medallion developed years ago have had very long legs because people stay at the firm. And they have a good reason to stay, because it 's so profitable.
12112 12112 But this seems unlikely as the administration continues to significantly downplay the severity of the crisis.
12113 12113 would be for the Trump administration and Congress to agree to a large ( at least $ 400 billion ), well-thought-out fiscal stimulus package.
12114 12114 They now appear to realize recession is likely and have begun to talk about fiscal stimulus. They are too late to forestall a recession, but if they act aggressively they could cushion the blow for the downturn.
12116 12116 Given that the vehicle industry was critical to all of manufacturing, and failure of the industry would result in tens of millions more job losses, the federal government bailed it out,.

12125 12125 But I do think it will start tapering off.
12126 12126 It 's important to step back from today 's UI numbers and remember that this labor market crisis did n't have to happen. Due to failed leadership, we twice missed the chance to avert widespread job loss. Now policymakers must act to avoid greater damage.
12127 12127 The way a recession can really hurt people just starting out can have lasting effects,.
12129 12129 In a worst-case scenario, it could trigger another financial crisis,.
12134 12134 There are a lot of people out there wondering if they 're serving their bodies well by the way they consume food, and this is a good opportunity to address some points,.
12135 12135 The disruption points to that fact so we need to think differently about logistics overall beyond whats going on with this event.
12138 12138 We did not initiate the withdrawal from the agreement [ OPEC + deal ]. On the contrary, we proposed to extend the agreement on the existing terms, at least until the end of the second quarter or for a year, so as not to complicate the situation that has developed with the spread of coronavirus,.
12147 12147 You have to balance different sectors of the economy, and some are more sensitive than others. If they 're deemed important to full employment, maybe the Fed is willing to tolerate some inflation to try to stimulate those sectors.
12148 12148 [ I ] n the vast majority of companies in which a hedge fund activist is not agitating for change, the Big Three pay little attention to whether a company suffers from financial or business underperformance that might call for ` fixing the management.
12151 12151 I never thought I would be drinking shots with first minister.
12152 12152 I would never, under any circumstances, be touching ( the complainer ) inappropriately. These are all public places. It would be insane to do anything like that. These claims are a fabrication.
12154 12154 Once we see things settle and people are sure the sky is n't falling, then we expect a lot of buyers will move from the sidelines and rush into the market with a lot more buying power than just a few months ago. So it may not only recover ; it could boom,.
12158 12158 The range of potential scenarios is very large, spanning oil supply shocks or even oil demand destruction -- which would be negative to oil prices.
12161 12161 We might see a double bottom,.
12164 12164 We are trying to solve the problem of learners whose classes have been suspended by negotiating with the local governments involved, the governors, mayors and so on so they can identify spaces where they can put up temporary shelters for the evacuees so the students can go back to school,.
12168 12168 While feeding themselves is not a problem to many Chinese nowadays, eating novel food or parts from rare animals or plants has become a measure of identity to some people.
12170 12170 Given that attempts to create new opportunities for U.S. exporters by changing rules and policies have n't been overwhelmingly successful in recent years, I can see why the administration might feel that setting out targets and asking a state-dominated economy to meet those targets is a way to do it,.
12172 12172 This might mean a larger negative impact on growth in China in the near term but perhaps a less protracted one,.
12174 12174 If we are to spearhead the energy transition, we must be an example for doing so in the most sustainable way, and this involves making sustainability part of everything we do,.
12175 12175 It 's important the party truly support women and those from minority backgrounds to stand for both committees or else people are likely to assume they 're engaging in tokenism.
12181 12181 They ( trade bodies ) are aware that the state could not help by slashing tax rates after the GST was introduced. Perhaps that is why we are receiving requests for supportive assistance. I can say I heard all the issues, but I ca n't promise anything right at this moment,.
12183 12183 As a result, the Soviet Union lost approximately $ 20 billion per year, money without which the country simply could not survive.
12187 12187 if we 're not going to get that legislation anytime soon what can we do that might be acceptable to get going right away ?.
12189 12189 Reported US cases continue to accelerate as the pace of testing is ramped up, and the virus continues to spread. The number of daily US deaths is likely to rise for several more weeks, at least. City lock-downs are spreading, so the rate of increase of new infections ought to start slowing by early April,.
12193 12193 The disruption [ in China ] could spill over to the rest of the global economy,.
12197 12197 Not having diagnosed the illness of the patient, the doctor is helpless. The least the doctor can do is to say, I am sorry. We made a mistake, will Manmohan Singh come and advise us,.
12199 12199 When there are large firms whose financial statements are not dependable, it creates ripple effects, affecting the credibility of statements of other firms too. If wealth had not been eroded by wilful defaulters, we could have spent almost double on the social sectors.
12200 12200 will be the ones that will have higher numbers of hospitalizations, higher numbers of deaths and where many of the resources should be concentrated.
12207 12207 It seems very clear to me that Republicans and conservatives faced a genuine extinction event back in 2007 and 2008, w hen not only did n't they anticipate a truly menacing housing and credit bubble that was building up that various others were warning about, but when those bubbles burst they seemed paralyzed because of this extreme anti-government ideology that had swept over the entire party and nearly the entire conservative movement.
12208 12208 I would agree with you on the importance of translation,.
12210 12210 Protectionism and also things like populism tend to surface the most when the pie stops growing. When the pie either starts growing much more slowly or begins to even shrink. It 's when we see you know, the nationalistic tendencies, the populist tendencies, the protectionist attitude resurface,.
12213 12213 We are probably going to hit our peak anywhere from April 4 and April 10,.
12214 12214 [ Qantas ] deserve public support but I 'd rather it be something managed together rather than injections of cash all the time ... and, dare I say it, the industry super funds could be part of a solution as an investor.

12217 12217 reduces the immediate disruption but could allow the virus to spread further for longer.
12219 12219 Some observers may initially view the ECB package as somewhat underwhelming. However, the long-term liquidity injections with a rate 25 basis points below the deposit rate can be seen as a rate cut in disguise,.
12224 12224 While it is with a heavy heart that we temporarily close our John Lewis shops, our partners will, where possible, be taking on important roles in supporting their fellow partners, providing critical services in Waitrose shops and ensuring our customers can get what they need through Johnlewis.com, which is seeing extremely strong demand.
12227 12227 I do n't want to talk about the personal. Because we need to move beyond the personal tragedies, otherwise it would be a competition of victimhood. My emphasis has always been about let us find ways to see Kashmiris as a collective have been victims over all, amongst other things competing nationalisms.
12228 12228 If the full benefits of reduced oil prices passed on consumers, the prices of petrol would have fallen close to Rs100 per litre in the domestic market,.
12230 12230 There has never been a famine in a functioning multiparty democracy. A free press and the practice of democracy contribute greatly to bringing out information that can have an enormous impact on policies for famine prevention.
12232 12232 Do n't exercise, because increasing your physical activity increases your respiratory rate, and consequently, your smoke exposure. If you have air conditioning it should be running so the filtering can improve the indoor air quality.
12234 12234 If members feel same-sex attraction and are striving to live the law of chastity, leaders support and encourage them in their resolve. These members may receive Church callings, hold temple recommends, and receive temple ordinances if they are worthy.

12240 12240 economics which you can put on the blackboard, in which you study an imaginary system. It 's not empirically based at all. It 's not concerned with what really happens. It 's what you imagine could happen and what you imagined did n't happen ... That 's called blackboard economics. It 's something you can put on the blackboard but that does n't exist.
12244 12244 The trade/current account deficit tells you nothing about an economy 's strength, weakness, or purchasing power,.
12251 12251 I 've believed that expansions end usually with tight monetary policy or credit problems. And I think what we 're doing is definitely borrowing from the future, and will probably end badly as the ` 07 period did. But that could be years.
12252 12252 Since manufacturers need to activate their entire supply chain to produce, they should be encouraged to plan on how the entire chain will reopen. The administrative structure to approve these plans and facilitate movement for those approved should be effective and quick-it needs to be thought through now,.
12255 12255 As every economist knows, inflation -- not a budget deficit -- is the tell-tale sign of an economy that is under pressure from excessive spending. If prices are n't accelerating, you do n't have an inflation problem. And if you do n't have an inflation problem, you do n't have a spending problem.

12278 12278 Our approach to fighting the pandemic starts from something more fundamental : in a liberal democracy you have to convince and not command people into action. If you lose that principle, you will lose your soul ... Perhaps Tegnell and his team will turn out to be wrong .... But their point is that the people deserve policies that work for longer than a month.

12288 12288 The key is what can we do to make sure that we accelerate the recovery ? The danger is that the recovery is too slow and then too many people stay unemployed. So, we need to accelerate as much as we can.

12303 12303 Ideally, the United States wants to follow the trajectory of Hong Kong, Singapore, or Japan. Even South Korea shows a very important flattening of the curve. The United States is the only country that shows a concave curve, which is, how you say, not good.

12309 12309 I do n't think Bernie or the other Democratic candidates are wrong that we are in a historical abnormality of tax giveaways to high-income people and big corporations. The question is : Is it conceivable to get $ 20 trillion of taxes just from high-income people ?.

12317 12317 The period during which the country grew at high GDP growth rates like nine %, the exports-to-GDP ratio was 20 %. But now with developed countries resorting to protectionism and after the collapse of the WTO, contribution of exports to GDP in a large way does not seem possible.

12321 12321 If anything, the trade deficit has increased. Distressed areas have not recovered. Inequality is still appalling. But this is no reason to overlook the positives. Assessment, rather than denial, is needed to shed light on what is happening.
12325 12325 A key takeaway for negotiators and countries is that they should build on what they produced in Madrid, rather than view it as a bad deal that we managed to avoid,.
12326 12326 For example, abolishing the marketing boards, which was said by the Washington consensus, but we now know that was why agriculture was doing well. Because at least it provided some stability for farm prices and farmers could be guaranteed a market,.

12367 12367 There are many large multinationals with strong balance sheets and little debt, but there are also many highly leveraged companies that will likely face a Hobson 's choice-make their debt payments in a timely way or cut payrolls and investment. Either way the economy will suffer,.
12368 12368 I do n't think it will come back as strong as before. I think it 's going to take a while,.
12371 12371 I do n't think a lump sum works, at least for most homeowners,.
12380 12380 Given the cultural politics in the state of Utah, if there were a spike in excommunications, we would have heard about it,.
12384 12384 I think this is an exceptional buying opportunity.
12390 12390 a target to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner.
12394 12394 The time for women is turning in the Middle East. If we are to just bring the MENA to par with the more advanced economies, over the ( coming ) years, there would be $ 1 trillion more in output for everybody to share. So, we are talking about very significant improvements.
12400 12400 This crisis will test whether the change made in the wake of the financial crisis will serve their purpose,.
12407 12407 they 're working very hard to contain the epidemic, they have brought US $ 115 billion equivalent liquidity so they can perk up the economy,.
12414 12414 While new risks could emerge, none of the main sources of recent recessions -- oil shocks, inflationary overheating, and financial imbalances -- seem too concerning for now. As a result, the prospects for a soft landing look better than widely thought.
12418 12418 Distributors wo n't play around with prices if the situation lasts a few days,.
12421 12421 I think people want sustainability and they want good environmental stewardship until they have to pay for it,.
12424 12424 The unemployment rate is also expected to decline, which should give people the confidence to spend. So it is reasonable to expect that things improve from here, although it is hard to be precise about how much longer this period of balance sheet adjustment will continue.
12425 12425 It certainly remains the case that a further reduction in interest rates would help with the balance sheet adjustment by households with existing debt, which should help bring forward the day that consumption strengthens,.
12427 12427 Australian governments and business can borrow at the lowest rates of since Australia became a federation.
12431 12431 I wish I could give you the answer ... I do n't have a crystal ball.
12432 12432 Assuming the unemployment rate rises 0.1 % per month, the earliest the RBA would cut is in June assuming a 5.5 % print in May is considered a material deterioration,.
12436 12436 The voice option is the only way in which dissatisfied customers or members can react whenever the exit option is unavailable,.
12438 12438 We are not global health experts. The WHO is, so we are relying on the WHO to tell us what information they believe will lead to imminent harm and that information comes down, and it comes down if anyone in the world says it.
12441 12441 You 're either dating the wrong person or you 're not giving him credit for being the right person,.
12443 12443 They 've been calling their grandparents very regularly. They 've been calling other adults in their life. Give everyone something they can do to help someone else,.
12445 12445 If prices are going up and there 's no change in margin at supermarkets or wholesalers and it 's all benefiting farmers, that 's OK. I do n't think anybody 's going to begrudge the farmers making a bit more money at the moment or recovering past losses.
12447 12447 We are pleased to see that speeds have generally improved, however, we need more action from NBN Co and RSPs so that all consumers can access their full NBN plan speeds,.
12453 12453 ensure price fixing is not allowed, and guard against anti-competitive consequences. And when the crisis is over authorisation can be revoked.
12456 12456 We would hope there would be a more comprehensive deal between the U.S. and China as the months go by,.
12458 12458 we must all prepare for an attack by the government.
12466 12466 make any more fans or money.
12467 12467 My preference would be to wait for the stress tests, but different people can have different opinions about that.
12470 12470 The virus' near-term effects on the supply side of the economy, including the reduction in activity from closures, reduced social interactions, cuts in travel and tourism, and disruptions in supply chains, are not things that can be affected by lowering interest rates,.
12472 12472 There 's no reason to wait a week because you can start getting those benefits as soon as possible,.
12473 12473 Less than 30 % of workers can work from home,.
12479 12479 We believe that there is still much to do ; so much to contribute through quality education in our land. It is the only way we can eradicate poverty, it is the only way we can instil discipline.
12484 12484 If there is one African country or one country anywhere in the world that still has the coronavirus, the whole world has it. We 've seen the speed of contamination and how quickly it can re-spread.
12485 12485 We do not want to compound the situation by vilifying a particular race or gender. If we see people ignorantly attacking foreigners, let us be the exemplary and educate them because we are the UN, that is what we do,.
12488 12488 Persistent negative interest rates, such as the negative 10-year government yields in much of Europe, are unprecedented and should be a matter of concern. There is some natural real rate of interest -- it is small but positive, and rates around the world have been below this for almost a decade.
12489 12489 That verse means a lot to me and I felt that it would encourage them as well,.
12493 12493 You saw tonight, we had a lot of just wide-open looks out of the initial pin down action either between Al [ Horford ] and [ Josh Richardson ] or Al [ Horford ] and [ Alec ] Burks so we got a lot of easy ones going and just were able to go at different mismatches that we felt.
12494 12494 This would never pass a popular vote,.
12495 12495 During this pandemic crisis, those who have been told they 're self employed, their employer has n't been paying into unemployment insurance or workers compensation or providing them with sick leave,.
12497 12497 We support our operators to make local decisions that are geared to protecting all residents and staff. The site makes decisions about visitation based on clinical judgment of a patient 's current condition and prognosis. In end of life situations when there may be a critical need to visit a loved one, visitors with or without symptoms may be provided with Personal Protective Equipment ( PPE ) and escorted to and from the room. In this unprecedented time, we must weigh priorities, taking into consideration the health and safety needs of all patients and staff and how best to provide support at end-of-life. These are very hard decisions and situations for all involved,.
12500 12500 Given the advice we are receiving from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, other public health officials, and our own faculty, who are among the world 's leaders in infectious disease, epidemiology, and virology, it is difficult to imagine how we could safely hold such a large gathering this spring,.
12501 12501 As of today, around 15 percent of global energy-related greenhouse gas emissions come from the process of getting oil and gas out of the ground and to consumers. A large part of these emissions can be brought down relatively quickly and easily.
12502 12502 Monday 's meeting with OPEC-plus countries can well be a good start, but even the numbers people are talking about may not be enough to find a solution to the problem,.
12503 12503 only technology which can find a breach between the economic development priorities of the emerging Asian countries and climate change.
12506 12506 Demand is expected to contract by 435,000 bpd at the start of this year and we may need to revise it downwards,.
12507 12507 Given the continuous rise in crude oil prices along with a weakening rupee, the operating environment would continue to remain challenging for the company, going forward. Hence, we drop coverage on the company,.
12508 12508 Housing starts finally broke above 1.5 million for the last three months, so there was a signal that the inventory situation could be improving through the latter part of the year,.
12509 12509 Having government backing means consumers will pay around 30 basis points lower than a loan without government backing. That can translate into around $ 1,500 in savings a year on a $ 500,000 mortgage.
12512 12512 February 's pending sales figures show the housing market had been very healthy prior to the coronavirus-induced shutdown. The data does not capture the significant fallout from the pandemic or the measures taken to control the outbreak.
12515 12515 We estimate the likely impact on U.S. consumers and find that by the end of 2018, import tariffs were costing U.S. consumers and the firms that import foreign goods an additional $ 3 billion per month in added tax costs and another $ 1.4 billion per month in deadweight welfare ( efficiency ) losses.
12520 12520 We know that business owners in this county have invested a great deal of time, energy and money into their businesses and we 'll be contacting them to go through any concerns or queries relating to crime prevention that they may have.
12525 12525 Businesses are n't closing and people are n't unemployed due to any fault of their own. And I think this is a clear as possible case that those are n't relevant considerations.
12526 12526 There is nothing fundamentally wrong with the U.S. economy. It came into the year in a very strong position in terms of employment and growth and financial markets and I 'm confident we can get back there.
12528 12528 I would see the third quarter as a transitional quarter,.
12530 12530 Monetary policy can not solve this crisis on its own,.
12531 12531 It is beyond belief that anybody would want to use the name of a dinner that degraded and objectified women to sell a clothing label. I call on House of Fraser and all the other stores stocking this range to think again and take this brand off the shelves,.
12535 12535 It would be a miracle if Canada does n't have a recession, but we should n't bank on miracles,.
12536 12536 The question is, while those responses are necessary in the near term, what if this continues ? You ca n't keep helping companies that continue to make losses. The longer this drags on, the more likely we will need to adjust to a new normal.
12539 12539 I do n't think that would be wise. That will really impact on the kind of learning the children will have, without undergoing the lesson,.
12540 12540 They suspect they have a degree of exposure,.
12541 12541 Areas deprived of proper sanitation and sewerage systems fall prey to these diseases, which can be fatal,.
12546 12546 Majority Leader McConnell is free to schedule a vote to confirm Dr. Lemos anytime he wants to -- and, frankly, I suspect he would have even more than 53 votes to do that.
12552 12552 publicly owned or controlled homes.
12553 12553 If it had been bipartisan, and they had held hands and said, ` This is the thing we ought to do,' then you are n't exposed to the Republicans screaming about every dollar that did n't go right,.
12554 12554 If the crisis turns into a catastrophe, they will not be able to hide it any more,.
12558 12558 If we can get that straight, then we know how to get the economy working again. Monetary and fiscal policy can do their thing. And we wo n't have anything like the extended downturn we saw in -- even I do n't think in the Great Recession much less the Great Depression of the '30s.
12561 12561 Once you get that, the thing can balloon very quickly.
12566 12566 Question for the MPC is whether 2020 is starting with a bang.
12567 12567 The market curve in January predicts some loosening of policy, but this would lead to inflation being a little above target.
12568 12568 investing in a net-zero world must go mainstream.
12573 12573 It 's not just green assets and divestment campaigns or certain things are so brown or black. Every company ultimately has to have a plan for a transition and what the opportunities are and where the risks are,.
12577 12577 We lower our 2020 and 2021 growth forecasts to 6 per cent and 6.2 per cent ( 6.2 per cent and 6.5 per cent prior ) given likely delays to eventual oil production,.
12579 12579 I think we can look forward to a robust recovery when the troubles are behind us,.
12582 12582 There are significant measures happening today and next week which I think people should see as a coordinated and very powerful package ... to weather the storm,.
12583 12583 If you only look at 2010 to today, this is the zeroth percentile event. That is, in a decade quite bad for value investing, the start of 2020 is the absolute worst 6-week period.
12587 12587 The long term depends on the overall reduction of potential and actual conflicts, which does not seem to be an immediate outcome or even medium-run result,.
12589 12589 I think what that shows is [ people do n't focus ] so much on the profit of the organization,.
12590 12590 When people raise questions that you did n't do this or that, the fundamental reason for that was that dollars had been depleted and nobody was ready to give us a loan.
12591 12591 China is set to do little more than restore agricultural purchases and offer some nice words on financial services and intellectual property. Trump could have had that two years ago without the tariff damage.
12594 12594 This is a very important initiative to ensure that just because somebody may be impoverished or maybe struggling to pay a bill, they do n't lose their right to travel and to go to their place of work,.
12596 12596 Our work is how we can help African countries to use these blessings. We are investing heavily in projects that help nations use their resources, like in oil and gas and agriculture,.
12601 12601 This is not a normal economic event in any way, shape, or form,.
12610 12610 When we face the outbreak of disease worldwide, it is important to understand each other and if the disease is not contained in a part of the world, we actually help its spread in other parts of the world,.
12611 12611 I do n't want to comment on this issue as I do not have the habit of passing judgement on issues about which I have at most got three-and-a-half minutes to read in newspapers. Had I known more about the incident, I would surely have had an opinion on it,.
12614 12614 How did armed thugs have the opportunity to beat up students at JNU or AMU ? How was it possible for a young protester to be roughed up while in custody ? Why was a doctored video put in circulation trying to tell a false story about what happened in one campus or other ?.
12615 12615 Individuals are very interested in the knowledge that matters to them directly -- e.g., a person learns about motorcycles before buying one ... Individuals will not take the trouble to understand GST or Public Debt Management Agency. This is because people respond to incentives : The improvement to the life of an average person, from devoting 10 hours to learning GST, is roughly zero.
12618 12618 We must replant Germany and Austria Jews in Palestine in order to transport this polluted water from our streets and lakes.
12619 12619 With luck, the Italian response can at least help to slow down the advance of the virus,.
12620 12620 Ten or 20 years from now, we will all remember what happened at this time, like all Germans remember where we were when the Berlin Wall came down,.
12621 12621 And I think that, the more we can talk about it in a song like that, the better off we 'll be in a place to call it out when it 's happening. So many of these things are ingrained in even women, these perceptions, and it 's really about re-training your own brain to be less critical of women when we are not criticizing men for the same things.
12627 12627 We 're getting phone calls from interested investors, and we believe our employment area and Barrie 's would complement each other,.
12630 12630 Our policy advisory is that regulators should monitor potential risk and that they should take actions preemptively in order to protect financial stability,.
12634 12634 If uncertainty around the future trade arrangement or subdued global growth continued to weigh on UK demand then my inclination is to respond with a vote for a cut in rates in the near term,.
12635 12635 It is likely that much of the increase in at-home work will become permanent, even after the immediate health emergency passes, so it is crucial policymakers pay top-priority attention to ensuring the safety and fairness of work from home arrangements,.
12638 12638 But I think we see economics as a tool to change the system.
12639 12639 In the current uncertain circumstances we face, we are certain that some people are going to need big spending power fast, but it is also certain that if the economy is going to come back best, fastest, investment in new plants, machinery, equipment, etc. is key,.
12647 12647 This time around, it 's going to be corporate debt and shadow banks that lend to these corporates. Eventually you could have a credit boom and bust and a crisis -- give it a couple of years.
12648 12648 I think for most small and medium sized businesses they kind of are the same thing right now,.
12649 12649 It 's thought to be a safe haven.
12654 12654 It is also true that the time demands of many jobs can explain much of the pay difference, a finding that has sobering implications.
12656 12656 the Fed operates independently, as it should.
12657 12657 The main problem, it seems to me, is really to make liquidity available to all, credit available to all. And the supply of liquidity, the supply of credit, is more important than the price.
12658 12658 Those companies should open their coffers and provide funds for these drivers to provide some regular standard of living to whatever they 've had in the last several months on average. These companies should provide that level of support.
12661 12661 Having said that, I still think the fundamentals for Intel are good for a long-term play.
12664 12664 The global financial crisis in 2008-09 was a massive demand shock, but our workers could still go to work, our firms were coming off years of strong growth, our financial system was largely sound, and our government finances were healthy. None of this is true today as we fight the coronavirus pandemic,.
12667 12667 The governor of our state has a close relationship with my eldest son, who is the chair of the board at Mass General -- a great hospital -- and he asked if there was a way that they could get these masks that they had bought in China back to America,.
12677 12677 This could be more generous terms for loans to banks and/or direct purchases of securities.
12680 12680 Once you get past tipping points, we do n't really have a good handle on what may happen.
12681 12681 So, in no way voter turnout of general election could surpass the turnout of municipality polls,.
12682 12682 The market is waiting for a circuit breaker which can reverse the current negative narrative.
12689 12689 Going by the way India walked out of the RCEP deal at the last minute, and its decision to increase tariffs on a slew of items to protect its domestic industry, it is likely that the US will also be approaching a potential deal with extreme caution,.
12690 12690 I believe we are very much on the same side and working toward the same goals. And I hope we can continue a dialogue on how to achieve those goals.
12693 12693 I think this show allows us to go onto that ride of, ` Oh my god, this is happening in our society, today in America. In' 77, but also in 2020.' We should be afraid of the warning signs, so-to-speak, because evil is always lurking right behind the corner.
12694 12694 We do n't want to make them caricatures, or then we do a disservice to the efforts of so many who combat fascism and Nazis.
12695 12695 If you look at stock market rates of return, or at the rate at which top billionaire wealth rises year after year, it is clear that the relevant rate of return is substantial, and much larger than the growth rate,.
12697 12697 This process is likely to continue until auto producers finally switch to other precious metals, like platinum and rhodium,.
12700 12700 Even if a doctor was there.
12704 12704 If we ignore God 's word, we end up cutting ourselves off from truth about God. If we ignore what He said, we cut ourselves off from that truth,.
12705 12705 It 's not used a lot on Saturdays, so I can see where they 're coming from with closing it.
12706 12706 Real median earnings have been rising for more than a half decade, even if it may not feel that way to some wage earners whose wages have flatlined or even trended down over that period.
12710 12710 If it were me, I think I would try to coordinate a fiscal policy response, but that does n't seem to be looming right now,.
12715 12715 These new data are worrisome, if not alarming -- for they demonstrate that large-scale female feticide has been taking place among certain U.S. sub-populations over the past decade,.
12716 12716 We can do better as a country than propagating hate speech. Why stooping so low as to have these so called Nyekhwe [ DPP war-cry ] songs. We need the youth to be development conscious,.
12717 12717 Leadership is not a determining factor as we explore alliances. I want to go into an alliance with motivation to address issues affecting Malawians. It is not so much about me. It is about how we deliver change. If the alliance decides that moving forward should mean I take the lead, so be it. If not, that 's also fine,.
12719 12719 ` We 've already have unprecedented levels of deaths of despair, and if we have a lost generation as a result of the coronavirus pandemic that 's going to have mortality consequences.'.
12720 12720 would have the wisdom to steer the nation forward.
12722 12722 I do n't think it 's quite going to be the same in China ... but nonetheless, terrific day for Tesla and well-deserved because they 've innovated with a product that many of us love.
12723 12723 If you would have asked me a year ago if this team would be here, I would have said no way just with everything that we lost,.
12726 12726 What worries me is whether or not we 've put these countries into a new kind of debt problem,.
12727 12727 is that if you just look at the individuals in the intervention group, it would look like the program caused a huge reduction in readmissions. But when you look at the individuals in the control group -- who were eligible for the program but were not randomly selected to get it -- you see the exact same pattern.
12728 12728 Lots of things got wrapped in cellophane to avoid being touched by other customers. Would you want to buy a toothbrush from a bin that a hundred people rummaged through ?.
12731 12731 It is especially hard to imagine that, having just suffered a serious blow as a result of losing a top general [ Soleimani ], possibly thinking about more revenge, and having resisted sanctions for the last 18 months, that Iran will suddenly start acting differently.
12732 12732 non-essential personal or business travel away from Dane County,.
12734 12734 Climate is not concerned about whether emissions are reduced in the UK or Germany or China ; so long as they are reduced, that helps to address the problem.
12738 12738 It 's clear that government funding cuts in the first instance, and rejections of extra funding in the second, have contributed to the severity of the fire catastrophe. Think of that the next time you hear someone extol the virtues of a budget surplus and low government spending,.
12740 12740 The period during which the country grew at high GDP growth rates like nine per cent, the exports-to-GDP ratio was 20 per cent. But now with developed countries resorting to protectionism and after the collapse of the WTO, contribution of exports to GDP in a large way does not seem possible.
12745 12745 I would do 10 more,.
12749 12749 Either there 's going to be massively higher taxes, a massive reduction in the ambition of what he 's proposing or a massive increase in the deficits and debts,.
12760 12760 We may begin to see many more universities where students do not come to campus but turn on their zoom sitting at home,.
12764 12764 I think the message we 're hearing here is that pro-Israel advocacy transcends political parties and it should n't be hijacked by any side.
12765 12765 Our experts are working to assess the damage. Once again, we appeal to everyone, tell your relatives who have left, who are now in Kyrgyzstan with their relatives -- they must return.
12772 12772 The rejection of Cross is a strong signal against the powerful influence of the banking lobby in Brussels. A former banking lobbyist as head of banking supervision would have done serious damage to the reputation of the EU authority. Such conflicts of interest undermine confidence in EU authorities.
12773 12773 we must ensure all the necessary inputs to the algorithm, including the data used to test and create it, are carefully stored.
12774 12774 If you have a factory that 's shut down, and it 's shut down for a week because of a cyclone, then next week you 're just going to use more capacity to meet your back orders ; the actual amount of economic activity and output is n't diminished hardly at all,.
12776 12776 The impact of the coronavirus on oil markets may be temporary but the longer-term challenges facing the world 's suppliers are not going to go away, especially those heavily dependent on oil and gas revenues,.
12781 12781 If that 's the case then this is the low point for the Treasury -- but on the other hand there are consequences if the virus spreads.
12783 12783 They can negotiate for better prices,.
12784 12784 Even fast-growing markets could be hurt and unable to further expand because of weakening affordability conditions,.
12785 12785 Or if needing to sell a home in the near future, then there is less equity by the amount of the missed payments. So it is an honor system but also honorable to keep paying if not impacted from the pandemic.
12787 12787 Yes, I 'm gon na be making a very substantial gift. I do believe in it, and I believe in the impact it can have.
12797 12797 I think I 'm helping people remember that dating, for those who want to do it, is part of moving forward, and it is option B,.
12799 12799 I 'm a demanding boss, and I 'm a tough boss. I think I 'm a very fair boss. But I 'm demanding,.
12807 12807 has to be in the dozens, if not hundreds.
12808 12808 I live in New York City and people there are hardly going to restaurants, cinemas or theaters, even though nobody there has been infected by the virus thus far. If it comes, we are totally f * * * ed.
12809 12809 If you run a budget deficit of 10 % to 15 % of GDP while printing money financing, we end up like Zimbabwe, like Argentina, like Venezuela, with high inflation and eventually hyperinflation,.
12810 12810 If we win the war, we can recoup that money.
12811 12811 If you 're going to have a recession, then you 've got to have two bad quarters, and I think that 's going to depend on whether we get ahead of the curve on the coronavirus, and that 's a big unknown right now.
12813 12813 We really could see the worst jobs reports we 've ever seen in our history.
12815 12815 Congress party has to reinvent itself if it has to be relevant,.
12822 12822 Ultimately, we determined that although there is a notable level of competition between the particular print titles, the transaction was not likely to substantially lessen competition because publishers in other media, particularly online publishers, will increasingly compete with Bauer.
12831 12831 The youth must be prepared for the jobs of the future -- not the jobs of the past,.
12834 12834 Think of it as a super-effective form of fiscal stimulus. Test kits are ridiculously cheap compared with the GDP and job losses they might forestall.
12840 12840 In general I think both on the inflation and employment side, we are performing pretty much close to target if not right on it, so that 's encouraging,.
12841 12841 The banking system in Europe and in Germany is not as robust and resilient as one would wish.
12845 12845 A lot of small businesses are run by the owner looking at his checking account going up or down, and that can give you a very misleading impression of the sustainability of the business,.
12846 12846 adopted an audacious system of proportional representation based on the amount of property each voter owned ( or the amount of tax paid ),.
12851 12851 But I think sometimes ... those people on the peripheries are sometimes the most forgotten and the most suffering. A little old, 80-year-old grandma living by herself an hour from the closest person, is one of the first people forgotten,.
12852 12852 But I was mistaken. It 's now clear that the deniers would sooner see the whole country destroyed than admit they have been wrong.
12853 12853 It would be a mistake to underestimate how effective.
12860 12860 If you look back a year ago, they were much more concerned about deposit competition and where it was going to go because of their belief that interest rates were going up and there was much more discussion about a possible recession. Now they 're much more positive in their outlook.
12863 12863 stands ready to adjust all of its measures, as appropriate, should this be needed to safeguard liquidity conditions in the banking system and to ensure the smooth transmission of its monetary policy in all jurisdictions.
12865 12865 If conditions continue to improve, though, it is likely that smaller and less frequent purchases of government bonds will be required,.
12866 12866 If interest rates had not been reduced last year this adjustment in household finances would have been more difficult and the overall economy would have suffered,.
12873 12873 The disruption could spill over to the rest of the global economy,.
12876 12876 still too soon to even speculate about either the size or the persistence of these effects, or whether they will lead to a material change in the outlook.
12877 12877 we do think that policy is appropriate, and, under our baseline outlook, will continue to be appropriate.
12878 12878 Until the virus is not contained, it would be very difficult to go to the lives we love.
12883 12883 Governments should continue and expand these efforts to reach the most-affected people and businesses -- with policies including increased paid sick leave and targeted tax relief,.
12890 12890 we would have technically been talking about recession.
12891 12891 a long-lasting and more severe outbreak would result in a sharper and more protracted growth slowdown in China.
12892 12892 The CCRT can currently provide about $ 500 million in grant-based debt service relief, including the recent $ 185 million pledge by the United Kingdom and $ 100 million provided by Japan as immediately available resources,.
12895 12895 This emergency financing would allow the government to address additional and urgent balance of payment needs and support policies that would make it possible to direct funds for priority health expenditures and protect the most vulnerable people and firms.
12896 12896 My advice would be to seek ways in which this element of uncertainty is reduced in the interests of everybody, the U.K., the EU -- and the whole world.
12901 12901 He must appear in his own right as an impartial and independent defender and custodian of the Constitution.
12908 12908 I could do it easy !.
12910 12910 Knebworth -- it would be a piece of piss to be perfectly honest,.
12911 12911 Brothers and Sisters make yourself known if your a health worker ? LG x # worldhealthday ( sic ).
12917 12917 We do not want the next generations to inherit a world which becomes ever more hostile and ever less habitable -- just think of the wildfires in Australia,.
12918 12918 With the world at such critical crossroads ... we must develop a ` Davos Manifesto 2020' to reimagine the purpose and scorecards for companies and governments. It is why the WEF was founded 50 years ago, and it is what we want to contribute to for the next 50 years.
12919 12919 They are more likely to have sailed out past the west of Ireland, well within international waters, before heading south.
12924 12924 should avoid further violence and provocations.
12930 12930 I do n't ever want to be that guy that 's like, ` Ahh, I should n't say that because it might upset somebody,'.
12933 12933 I would n't exclude that you do have some kind of coming together and this is resolved, but at the same time, the opposite -- a disintegration of the euro -- is also possible,.
12941 12941 That would be consistent with the initial claims for unemployment insurance data that we 're getting.
12943 12943 Right now, we do n't have a whole lot of confidence. I mean he ca n't seem to get on the same page with the experts, the CDC,.
12945 12945 If we solve the virus, we 'll quickly get our groove back,.
12947 12947 There have been several dramatic shifts which ought to make the U.S. economy resilient to rising oil prices. Strong household balance sheets, an accommodative Fed and a large domestic energy sector reduce the risks that an oil shock tips the economy into recessions. Though the U.S. economy can better withstand a jump in oil prices than it once could, the global economy is still vulnerable. â € œHigher oil prices are still very much a negative for the global economy, and that will reverberate back on us,.
12953 12953 If anything, I felt quite liberated and ` gangster' to just take on my baldness with no apology.
12955 12955 It will become free. For this, it will be necessary to independently or through the multi-service government center to file information in the Unified Federal Bankruptcy Information Register, which will allow people with a debt size of more than 50,000 rubles, but not more than 700,000 rubles, to get rid of debt obligations,.
12959 12959 We should clearly prioritize budget spending, keep inflation within the given parameters, no higher than 4 %,.
12963 12963 We can both stimulate the economy ... and we can lay the foundation for a lower-carbon future,.
12965 12965 I do n't think anyone alive at this moment is going to forget this [ pandemic ],.
12967 12967 Our economic policy, though, should be aiming to cushion the blow as much as possible.
12972 12972 Fed action and fiscal measures can only ameliorate the pain, and we remain worried that the latter are n't yet on a sufficient scale,.
12974 12974 We 're hoping today 's reading will be the peak, but we ca n't be sure and, in any event, total layoffs between the March and April payroll surveys look destined to reach perhaps 16-to-20mln, consistent with the unemployment rate leaping to 13-to-16 %. In one month,.
12975 12975 Businesses are not happy about the trade war, but the hit to sentiment seems to have been worse than the damage to real economic activity.
12976 12976 Claims likely have peaked,.
12977 12977 Prudence suggests we have to expect softer jobs numbers for the next few months.
12978 12978 This does n't mean we can be sure the downshift in Italy will continue, but the data give real grounds for hope,.
12979 12979 When you have these mutations in a host, it may take decades for them to expand to the point of causing issues,.
12984 12984 And it seems like even if the letter of the law may or may not have been broken, it 's incredibly clear that the spirit of the law has been broken.
12985 12985 But over the oncoming decades, there could be slower-moving economic impacts if interest rates move up some -- not a crisis, but some -- inflation moves up, the fiscal space ... diminishes, that would have a slower-moving but certainly negative impact on the nation as well.
12988 12988 It is already widely recognised that we will have a recession in the economy, which will probably be quite severe,.
12991 12991 On the fiscal side, the government is already planning to introduce a stimulus package in the near term. In our view, these efforts should be applauded,.
12992 12992 Since we began monitoring the virus, and that started months back, we in the College basically outlined three values around which we would be making decisions related to the virus,.
12993 12993 So we put out an appeal, everywhere we could think of on social media. We messaged Katie McCandless-Thomas on Dog Friendly Perthshire. She was fabulous in sharing it widely.
12994 12994 I am always trying to create music for the band. We are a team and I know when this is over we can come out stronger.
12995 12995 The bylaws should have been more clear about what constitutes as an ` academic listserv,.
12998 12998 The stage is now set for greater stabilisation and enhanced domestic productivity that would help overcome inflation, boost businesses and create more employment opportunities,.
13001 13001 There is a licence fee that would normally be payable ... there will be discussions between the Grand Prix Corporation and Formula One management about the nature of that fee, about whether it 's payable.
13002 13002 While our trade, tourism and education engagement is crucial, what matters more are the people-to-people relationships, and at this difficult time, it 's the people of China we are thinking of,.
13003 13003 If at any point the risk profile gets out of whack ... then obviously it will stop.
13004 13004 In that regard, I would hope that any conversations that are had with bankers and administrators are such that those people are able to keep their jobs.
13005 13005 Thus, according to the devil himself, all of the states on the Earth are under his command and depend on him. So, we can understand why they inflict so much harm,.
13007 13007 Overall this is good, it should get out quickly,.
13008 13008 Policymakers should quickly pass a big fiscal stimulus package,.
13009 13009 These programs are the lifeline for millions of people that will make sure they can make it while we shut down the economy,.
13010 13010 We will be reviewing all opportunities for projects that can get underway in the short-term and provide advice on how central Government could accelerate these should they wish to,.
13011 13011 a coordinated Federal-led shutdown for 30 days and then a gradual reopening with testing, testing, testing so we can kill the virus when it reappears.
13013 13013 I think you are totally wrong and causing harm,.
13015 13015 We can brag we have the most expensive health care,.
13017 13017 Leaders should ensure they put in place psychological safety so that people know candour is welcome,.
13024 13024 Essentially by hooking a laptop to the vehicle system, certain features may be adjustable.
13025 13025 Northern Ireland has well-prepared and rigorously-tested plans for dealing with infectious diseases, and these have been activated. This will help ensure that the patient receives appropriate care, and the likelihood of spread is minimised. I would like to reassure the public that the risk to the wider population remains low.
13032 13032 Given what we know now and unless there are major wars that take place or serious walls that get built everywhere, assuming that does n't happen, I think it is a pretty low probability scenario that would happen,.
13034 13034 There are many conflicts that could arise from climate change and when we do not take care of our environment. There could be higher rates of death, higher chances of getting ill and worsening food insecurity due to unforeseen calamities like the locust invasion in eastern Africa,.
13036 13036 Can I get some white wine ? Oh, you got the red wine ? Does that make me a difficult guest ?.
13037 13037 I feel like any of the scenes that take place in the concentration camps are handled with a great deal of reverence. Obviously, we know violence existed during that period of time, but in those cases, we prefer to suggest it than to show it,.
13038 13038 People are afraid to make content about incredibly sensitive or difficult subject matter,.
13041 13041 I think we 're still going to see a slight increase in 2020,.
13044 13044 There are many businesses who if they do n't quickly access this cash they are going to go under. That will have huge consequences for employment and also our ability to grow the economy when this pandemic has passed. If businesses collapse they wo n't be able to ensure our economy can recover. They will be lost forever.
13047 13047 Delaying until the end of the month would clearly be inappropriate.
13049 13049 With this market uncertainty, and the unknown impacts, a lot of people are wondering : well what could this possibly mean ?.
13050 13050 The executor can use this as a guide,.
13051 13051 Companies should also focus on innovation to boost skills [ ... ] and roll out massive corporate social responsibility programs to help vulnerable communities.
13052 13052 Economic growth can reach 2.5 % and even 0 %.
13053 13053 Self-distancing measures, work from home, or limited isolation wo n't work unless the people are given social security,.
13054 13054 Considering the difficulty of identifying the truly needy and the problems inherent in trying to do so, sending every American a $ 1,000 check asap would be a good start. A payroll tax cut makes little sense in this circumstance, because it does nothing for those who ca n't work.
13056 13056 Most teachers are socialists. Those who are not socialists have been arrested. After several such cases, the situation can not be changed. You have to take a big step by closing for two years. Good students at JNU must be housed at Delhi University and Ambedkar University, among others nearby. The rest must be discarded and after the necessary cleaning, it can be opened again,.
13061 13061 If consumer confidence will erode because of the virus then you 'd expect to see a downdraft in housing,.
13062 13062 This contribution can be especially powerful when the shock is global and the response is coordinated,.
13063 13063 at a time when they may have increased funding needs and credit conditions are tightening.
13064 13064 It seems we 'll have to wait for this month 's monetary policy report to see where the governor and his team land in interpreting these and other recent trends.
13068 13068 We could actually have free trade within Canada. What an amazing concept. By the way, that 's the reason why we did confederation,.
13072 13072 Ideally you want all those small and medium-sized businesses that were solvent and doing a great job as of Feb. 1 to still be around and able to do business when folks can get back to work,.
13080 13080 When talking to young people, most do n't want to sit in a serious circle -- it can be intimidating and distressing.
13083 13083 I would suggest that we all work together to first rectify the reservation that was there for the community. And we must fight for it. Otherwise we can not get anything .... You have to gather that data and create a condition to fight for it. Of course the political parties will fight for it but it must come from you,.
13091 13091 Everyone, that is, but one person. That person made $ 350,000 last year to infrequently write stories that generated little meaningful viewership or revenue.
13092 13092 Is there a time when I can get 15 minutes of your full attention ?.
13099 13099 This is a situation that should prove temporary.
13102 13102 The Bank of Canada highlights this factor in suggesting that the economy will continue to grow in 2020 and 2021. Certainly, it is a strong positive for the housing markets in these provinces,.
13104 13104 There can be no doubt, the US is Poland 's most important ally, and it is right that we should purchase military hardware from US manufacturers,.
13107 13107 We either save avoidable deaths & destroy society OR accept avoidable deaths & save society. The moral dilemma of our time.
13108 13108 Whether it be happiness or life satisfaction or other things like the economy.
13112 13112 That 's how we can help you best.
13113 13113 The open web allows any size company or individual creator in Canada to become a global business and reach customers,.
13115 13115 I think consumers morally have a right to know in advance what their out-of-pocket costs for care will be, and this effort does n't seem to provide that,.
13119 13119 But with the crisis at hand, the GDP of the world will come down by 2.2 per cent which looks small but is incredible in terms of the size and travesty it can cause,.
13122 13122 These are some examples of what such interventions can do. We support, give them an enabling environment, provide a platform and think of our prosperity in a sustainable fashion,.
13123 13123 This scenario would put Japan and Europe in recession, and the U.S. close to zero,.
13127 13127 What he has shown is if you put big enough tariffs on, that can change both the bilateral balance of trade,.
13131 13131 which suggests that in 1960, you had all these not-very-talented white men who were doctors and lawyers and lots of extremely talented people from other groups who were excluded. In the past 50 years, these groups have been changing places.
13134 13134 Taking what we saw in the first two weeks of March and then assuming things continue to get materially worse ... our first-quarter revenue growth could be as low as 2 % on an FX-adjusted basis. If things only get modestly worse from here in the coming days, our first-quarter adjusted revenue growth could be closer to 4 %.
13142 13142 But anecdotes can also spawn an, ` Oh, I should look at that in the data.
13147 13147 Looks like a lot of people should go to jail,.
13149 13149 Whenever you 're in a crisis, I think stimulus ca n't work until you tone down the public panic about the virus,.
13152 13152 We have already urged the government not to follow the Syria policy in Libya. We told them not to support one side but try to mediate between the fighting parties. Turkey has always followed this policy, between Iran and Iraq etc .. Turkey should embrace all the parties in this region and exert efforts for peace,.
13154 13154 I think a lot of the things we think of as unpredictable people did predict,.
13159 13159 LGBTQ youth are 120 percent more likely to experience homelessness than their straight and cisgender peers,.
13161 13161 This fiscal year, we will have surplus BoP. This indication can be seen.
13162 13162 This shows a need for better advice and education to help older Australians manage their savings so they can have the confidence to spend their money and enjoy retirement.
13166 13166 You may have seen some media reports relating to Edelweiss. I am writing to you directly, to assure you that Edelweiss has no relationship with Capstone Forex Pvt. Ltd and all allegations of FEMA violations are false,.
13167 13167 This is the quickest way we can, I think, jump-start government-wide climate action by encouraging agencies to use the tools that they already have,.
13169 13169 This Administration not only is not helping in our battle I think against the greatest threat we face on our planet -- there 's way too much carbon in the air, the climate crisis -- they 're actually going the wrong way, making it worse,.
13171 13171 I think in the short term, we do n't need to worry about how to pay for it, we need to be spending money as fast as we can offset the hole in the economy. But in the long term, we ca n't do that forever.
13172 13172 the long-term impact of fiscal stimulus depends on whether the income or transfer of receipts from the stimulus end up as capital investment ( highways, research and development, etc. ) that presumably add to private output per hour and standards of living.
13174 13174 We do n't have subpoena power. We do n't investigate every faculty member to determine whether or not they have outside engagements,.
13182 13182 If the NFL were to lose, I do n't think it is necessarily so dramatic in terms of the way you will watch NFL on satellite or cable,.
13184 13184 People should n't believe that we 're going to be running out of toilet paper anytime soon.
13186 13186 There are conditions in which consumers are willing to not think about the yucky factor,.
13191 13191 If we had a timely unemployment statistic, the unemployment rate would probably be up to 12 or 13 % at this point and moving higher,.
13193 13193 Five or 10 years ago, we would not have been buying,.
13195 13195 If I 'm not a monster, then what am I ?.
13196 13196 If stress is high, it 's hard to read a book but relatively easy to look at shopping websites,.
13202 13202 We just want to draw a map of what people think about, and how they respond.
13207 13207 described a fundamentally different approach to stock picking and investing in corporate securities by proposing that the investor should refrain from trying to anticipate price movements entirely. Instead, the investor should try to estimate the true Intrinsic Value of the underlying asset. Given time, the Intrinsic Value and market value would converge.
13209 13209 People will have to think about new trade routes, new production capacity .... We will have to rethink what borders are.
13210 13210 We can give to the world much more than what we get from it,.
13211 13211 famines are extremely easy to prevent if the government tries to prevent them, and a government in a multiparty democracy with elections and free media has strong political incentives to undertake famine prevention.
13212 13212 We must invest not only in artificial intelligence, but in human intelligence as well.
13218 13218 adamant that this is a long game ( six months or more ), and the longer we can hold out, and keep our students in school, even if just till term 2, the better,.
13222 13222 We need to see why we repeatedly go to the IMF. Structural transformations are needed in Pakistan 's production system -- agriculture, industry, or services -- to improve our productivity and export competitiveness,.
13223 13223 We tend to think of defensive medicine as ... doctors doing extra testing because they 're afraid of getting sued,.
13238 13238 If it goes well, it 's great for everybody. Everyone 's struggling to deal with this day to day, this changing world.
13239 13239 If you 've been ordered to close, the wage subsidy does n't help you,.
13243 13243 Efforts to make the production of high-protein foods more sustainable must continue. These foods, many from animal sources, are vital for the healthy growth of young children, especially those who already have poor quality diets. So, it is vital that their production can be undertaken in a way that respects planetary environmental boundaries.
13249 13249 We are either in a recession now or will be in one shortly,.
13250 13250 We want to see if our ordinance is up to date and whether we need to change.
13252 13252 I just thought I 'd let you know that I did test positive for corona. I am battling it pretty hard never felt so sick in my life ....
13253 13253 I 'm urging you to say that Merivale Road is not a lost cause, that we can fix Merivale Road, we can make it more liveable,.
13257 13257 We know that cities can attract the disproportionately young and innovative,.
13258 13258 ... the environment could be used as a sink without becoming fouled.
13259 13259 if we try, we can get there and we should get there for ourselves and for our children 's sake.
13260 13260 If you are not seen, you can not be found and you do not exist,.
13261 13261 Provided that the rise in unemployment is limited to a max of around four percentage points ( which I think is the aim of the government measures ) and provided that essentially viable businesses do n't have to be shut down, quite a lot of the economy will have a V-shaped recovery and GDP in 2021 or at worst early 2022 will be back where it was and on a growth track,.
13263 13263 All offences are investigated by officers who are specially trained to support victims and who can, if victims give their consent, put them in contact with the specialist organisations and partner agencies we work with including a network of independent sexual violence advisors, who can offer support.
13264 13264 Investors should apply pressure on company bosses, curb executive rewards, and ensure that those on the biggest salaries do the right thing by their workforce,.
13266 13266 The language would be less boilerplate. This would free us to explain our rationale and change the statement 's language productively from meeting to meeting without fear of sending the wrong message.
13276 13276 I ca n't believe that the media would think that my bro Javed Afridi and I would ever have an issue. I 'm actually laughing at this. Listen, guys, I love this man as my own brother. Are you guys serious ? Peshawar Zalmi is my baby and nothing comes between us. Absolutely nothing,.
13277 13277 Whether these students wind up as musicians or mayors,.
13280 13280 If it is a pandemic, if it does show up in Europe and the United States, then that is the prescription for a global and U.S. recession,.
13281 13281 If the virus becomes a pandemic, and the market says there is a reasonable chance it can become pandemic, a recession globally is likely,.
13282 13282 There are many large multinationals with strong balance sheets and little debt, but there are also many highly leveraged companies that will likely face a Hobson 's choice -- make their debt payments in a timely way or cut payrolls and investment. Either way the economy will suffer,.
13283 13283 People are n't going to feel like they 're getting the truth ... and if no one trusts, everyone panics.
13287 13287 It tells you about the risks if this goes on for several risks or several months,.
13290 13290 As many know, there is some evidence that I would have liked to have seen exposed in this trial, but for various reasons we have not been able to do so ; at some point those events will come to light, but it will not be this day for a very good reason,.
13294 13294 encouraged at least five other women to exaggerate or make claims against me.
13295 13295 Or we can follow his advice, solve this problem, and avoid a crisis.
13303 13303 He would write to Nehru, ` what 's this Gandhi saying', to which Nehru would reply, ` My dear Krishna, if you want to understand India, you should understand Gandhi'.
13307 13307 I know NATO is not a humanitarian aid organization, but what if NATO stepped in and took charge ? Because no other organization is able to take charge ; no other country is able to take charge.
13310 13310 We should not compete with ourselves while talking up our differences and talking down our strengths.
13311 13311 There is no reason for it to be as bad as 2008 if we act as we have, and if there is that targeted support,.
13319 13319 Malawians should find the right path in resolving issues with foreigners, not through property damaging and bookended,.
13323 13323 What we 're doing right now is reviewing country by country what are the financial needs, and engaging with these countries to make sure they are aware of this resource and we can immediately respond to them,.
13324 13324 From what we 've seen, the initial round of budget cuts from brands has focused heavily on influencer campaigns, either as total cancellations or postponing activity to the end of the year,.
13326 13326 If we did n't have this synchronised monetary policy, growth would have been in the zone that by IMF assessments lingers into recession. So very important to recognise the contribution monetary policy has made,.
13333 13333 A key concern about a long-lasting impact of the sudden stop of the world economy is the risk of a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs that not only can undermine the recovery. But can erode the fabric of our societies,.
13337 13337 a worldwide carbon tax would achieve in one fell swoop what myriad command-and-control measures can not easily replicate.
13338 13338 The economic tools we are using are important, but it 's anatural catastrophe or war -- we are in the middle of it and just getting out of it is kind of the main thing right now.
13344 13344 So I thought we should pull women 's speeches together. It started to feel more important to do it last year because women are more likely to be targeted by abuse or threats so celebrating their voices felt more important than ever.
13346 13346 The new Customer Choice Award this year is based on real votes from real customers so we urge everyone to vote for their favourite baker ; every vote really does count -- your local baker could walk off with one of our new awards.
13347 13347 Therefore, this is not an internal issue, rather, it is a global issue that should be taken into serious consideration.
13357 13357 With weaker electricity demand, power generation capacity is abundant. However, electricity system operators have to constantly balance demand and supply in real time. People typically think of power outages as happening when demand overwhelms supply. But in fact, some of the most high-profile blackouts in recent times took place during periods of low demand,.
13362 13362 We may see further downward pressure on prices in coming days and weeks,.
13363 13363 I should hope not. I am thoroughly convinced that the strategy is correct, which is proved by practice. I brought a concept when I started ( as CEO ). If the concept pivots I see no place for me in the company,.
13367 13367 Like in a war or a political crisis, there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shock.
13370 13370 Higher borrowing costs will expose financial vulnerabilities that have accumulated during years of low-interest rates, leading to a heightened risk that debt can not be rolled over,.
13371 13371 It is very likely that this year, the global economy will experience its worst recession since the Great Depression ( 1929-1933 ), surpassing what was seen during the global financial crisis a decade ago,.
13372 13372 Central banks should be ready to provide ample liquidity to banks and nonbank finance companies, particularly to those lending to small - and medium-sized enterprises, which may be less prepared to withstand a sharp disruption.
13373 13373 the combination should help in bringing down debt levels slowly over time.
13375 13375 There are no simple answers on how Africa can build cohesive and peaceful institutions when there is much reliance on natural resources,.
13376 13376 I think that is the tricky balance that government have to hit.
13377 13377 mission statement : to get the cash flowing, keep workers and we 're doing everything we can to get that done.
13379 13379 We are prepared to act in the market if liquidity conditions are such that it 's not two-sided and the exchange rate is not just moving around for no fundamental reason,.
13381 13381 We made a series of errors labelling this piece, and we apologise for any confusion this may have caused,.
13385 13385 should not be left in control of Facebook.
13390 13390 Some may perceive the coronavirus as the nail in the coffin, but it is n't, because it allows China to conduct a big stimulus,.
13393 13393 If I can reach just a small number of these kids, and make their lives better, and give them that shot, which is what people did for my family over the years, it 's really my pleasure and my obligation to do that.
13398 13398 Southern states risk facing a shortfall in the medium term unless there is more exploration and development in the south, or new infrastructure to bring more supply to southern states,.
13401 13401 We are seeking feedback from industry participants on whether the divestment package will be sufficient to address the competition concerns.
13402 13402 Medical technology companies will now be able to roll out a coordinated plan for supplies of medical equipment nation-wide, which is likely to be crucial in assisting Australia 's response to COVID-19,.
13403 13403 I think the gas industry as a whole certainly has to carry a lot of blame for the mess. And it is a mess that we are in ; the companies that are closing down and [ then ] the trouble this is causing for Australian manufacturing and Australian jobs,.
13405 13405 If the ACCC won 100 percent of the cases we took it would be a sign we were n't doing our job properly ; by only picking ` safe' cases and not standing up for what we believe in,.
13406 13406 The gas companies assured governments that the local market would be fine, that prices would n't go up. And that turned out not to be the case.
13407 13407 About 55 to 57 percent of the Democratic primary and caucus electorate are women, so if women are n't voting for her, by definition, how can it be sexist ?.
13408 13408 An entrepreneurial society needs an entrepreneurial state, one that through visionary and strategic public investments, distributed across the innovation chain, can create animal spirits in private businesses,.
13412 13412 Dismissal needs to be restricted in some way. No one should be left without jobs or food during this period. In this sense, we are providing all kinds of support to you. Unfortunately, some of the unemployed are uninsured and some are insured,.
13414 13414 final ball could do with improving.
13417 13417 As an ecologist, history is written in fossils. We know there were dinosaurs there and we know there were giant penguins too -- six feet tall in fact. We reconstructed a penguin from a single metatarsal that was found -- it is amazing what you can do with one bone,.
13420 13420 Our current recycling system is no longer economically viable, and in many cases could not be considered recycling-it goes in the right bin, but what happens next is another thing altogether.
13423 13423 We made sure that players could intuitively understand how to interact with the Circle while, behind the scenes, producers had access to robust functionality to allow them to manage players' interactions.
13433 13433 The first meeting was just him making sure that we were down-to-earth people, because he 's very much down-to-earth himself. He is an incredibly lovely and generous man of spirit, of his time, of his craft, and it was just so unique to see him come in and do what he did with this role. And in a way that I could 've never imagined.
13439 13439 Unemployment remained low, job growth was reasonably steady, inflation was moderate, the Federal Reserve had taken no recent steps to curb U.S. economic growth to avert wage or price inflation. Consumer confidence was reasonably high, and there was little sign of financial distress either among U.S. businesses or households.
13440 13440 Watch for scraps of information on the behaviour of consumers. If the thing is passing and you see people going back to restaurants and beauty salons ... things like that where you 're in close human contact, that would be a sign that the anxiety is being alleviated,.
13446 13446 It 's the sort of phraseology I use in print. I 'm really sorry if it hurt him, because I did n't mean to hurt him at all. I thought it was just part and parcel of the political colour.
13448 13448 In terms of prospects for this year, our expectation is that the economy will perform better than last year and we expect growth of 3 percent in terms of GDP growth. You have seen the forecast from the World Bank at 2,7 percent in terms of GDP growth and the IMF ( International Monetary Fund ) forecast is just below 2 percent. So there is some positive growth if one were to put all of those together, including our own 3 percent GDP growth rate.
13454 13454 Singapore marks our fifth international premium lounge, and we are delighted to develop our portfolio worldwide, offering sophisticated, modern and spacious lounges to our passengers, who can expect to receive exceptional services like never before throughout their journey with Qatar Airways.
13458 13458 These are bargains of a lifetime if we manage this crisis correctly,.
13461 13461 We 'd have to start to see a run on bottled water, self-quarantine, shutting down airports, that kind of thing, before it would be very scary from an economic perspective anywhere except China,.
13463 13463 first requires finding places where you can increase efficiency without increasing expenses,.
13464 13464 I think moral hazard in past circumstances, when it 's been associated with financial excesses or private sector excesses, is obviously something to assess and think about, but in this case this is an entirely exogenous event,.
13469 13469 I think you just have to take it a day at a time.
13476 13476 They should make it clear that further accommodation is necessary.
13478 13478 A G20 coordinated health, fiscal and monetary policy response would not only send a strong confidence message but also multiply the effect of national actions,.
13482 13482 If events in the Middle East drive oil prices up substantially, markets probably will become nervous about growth and will push the Fed to respond with lower interest rates,.
13484 13484 It did n't have to be this way ; the US could have followed the lead of several major European countries and offered job retention programs, paying most of people 's salaries, but preferred instead to increase and extend unemployment benefits,.
13486 13486 I think it 's probably somewhere around seven or eight per cent as sort of a one-off reduction due to the shut downs and the lock downs and the restrictions being placed on the economy.
13494 13494 I think I 'd end up sticking it on him.
13500 13500 The next decade must see unprecedented levels of collaboration if we are to meet global climate, biodiversity, and Sustainable Development Goals,.
13503 13503 Collectively, our aim should be that the pain caused by this Chinese virus should be minimal and the kickstart of the economy should be quicker,.
13507 13507 What has happened can lead to decoupling between the US and China. To me, this will keep global growth weaker in the years to come. Meanwhile, hard Brexit has been avoided for the time being, negotiations on a final deal will take more time,.
13514 13514 It 's one thing if Wuhan is on lockdown, another if all of China is on lockdown, another if all of Asia is on lockdown, and another if the whole world is on lockdown,.
13518 13518 Certainly, in some of the rural areas, which have not done well in the past few years. Building more roads there, more transfers, enhancing spending in the national rural employment guarantee plan. These would be ways of alleviating the stress in some of the poorest households.
13519 13519 We have already seen one consequence of not doing so - the movement of migrant labour. Another will be people defying the lockdown to get back to work if they can not survive otherwise.
13526 13526 In 2018 we estimated that 6.4 million Canadians already follow a diet that restricts meat partially or completely,.
13527 13527 The government should say ` we understand that and we are prepared to do whatever it takes. We have a bunch of policy options and we 're working on them now.'.
13528 13528 This has been a pressing concern for the past three years. The impact of protectionist actions and uncertainty about what might come next continues to hold back exports and investment globally,.
13534 13534 If your blood sugars run too high, you can have very severe complications. And it can kill you,.
13541 13541 At the same time the public needs to be fair to politicians as I think expectations were maybe raised too far ahead of last week 's agreement -- it is n't the new Jerusalem that many anticipated.
13545 13545 U.S. embassies throughout the world should be on alert, not just for the next few days but for at least another year.
13549 13549 ... they ( key indicators ) are either in negative growth or barely positive growth territory ... the comparison is to the real sector of the economy ... growth, investment, export and import ... which matter for jobs. It is also a matter of how much revenue the government has to spend on social programmes,.
13550 13550 bigger deficits would n't wreck the nation 's finances.
13553 13553 I think it 'll be a decline in exports, especially to China, say raw materials and rock lobster and other things.
13555 13555 We just ran the numbers carefully over the weekend, and we think second quarter 's going to be about minus 5 %, and we think the jobs number in early April might be as much as minus a million or so because ... nobody is going to get hired next week,.
13556 13556 The issue is we think next week .... there will be no hires,.
13558 13558 In such a scenario, raising India to become a $ 5 trillion economy by 2024-25 is wishful thinking.
13560 13560 lower interest rates can help overcome the economic and health anxieties.
13561 13561 is nowhere near where we should be.
13562 13562 The sky is not falling. This is a difficult time, but in many ways, it could be our finest hour.
13564 13564 hope [ s ] the price increase in 2020 is more moderate at 3 % or 4 %,.
13565 13565 On behalf of the board of directors and the PNB family, I would like to express our gratitude and sincere appreciation to Datin Paduka Kartini for her immense contribution to the group. We wish her well and look forward to continue working with her in her role as PNB 's nominee director on the boards of some of our investee companies,.
13569 13569 I know Joe Biden can do it. I 'm not sure who else can.
13570 13570 Quantitative easing and forward guidance can provide the equivalent of about 3 additional percentage points of short-term rate cuts.
13572 13572 The other possibility is people being exposed to environments that affect their immune systems following their release from hospitals, which could also result in re-activation.
13573 13573 We want the situation to plateau first. April 14-16 could be a kind of watershed moment that defines whether we level off or continue to see growth,.
13578 13578 I think there are three things why their happiness goes up,.
13580 13580 Just as no part of the global economy will be insulated from the impact of the virus, no major part of the global economy will be insulated if dollar funding markets break down,.
13582 13582 Currently, Hudson does not have any failing schools, but that could easily change with such a broken evaluation system,.
13585 13585 The Higgs boson relates to a force field that fills the universe in kind of an invisible way, except, as best as we can tell, it gives origin to the mass of all the fundamental particles.
13586 13586 the most likely profile of the economy would be a ` Nike swoosh' -- with near-term uncertainty impacting investment and confidence, ahead of a later recovery.
13587 13587 would never have become a software entrepreneur if he 'd stayed in Guwahati.
13589 13589 but there are things than can move us in that direction.
13591 13591 As I 've been in this transition period, it 's become ever more clear to me that our strength comes from our unity, and that sometimes just because something can be done does n't mean it should be done,.
13592 13592 If we look at the performance of equities since late 2018, the markets have been largely shrugging off any apparent risks to economic growth but if U.S.-China trade concerns and Brexit were n't enough to rattle investor sentiment, it appears that COVID-19 could be the tipping point.
13599 13599 Every economic crisis is a cleansing. One can exploit it to emerge stronger,.
13600 13600 It might seem shocking,.
13601 13601 The UK Presidency and all Governments should use this time to design resilient recovery and transition plans that consider climate, biodiversity, development and social justice in an integrated way,.
13605 13605 Back around 2005, 2006, it would be fair to say that China was intervening to keep the currency low,.
13606 13606 When the US cares a lot about a particular lending program, it can stop it by blocking it politically,.
13607 13607 leading in turn to more infections, and possibly to the virus' spread beyond Iran 's borders.
13613 13613 What Putin is trying to do is he 's putting his foot down in the Middle East wherever he can,.
13615 13615 Apple, what do you think,.
13625 13625 The same policy choice that helps the central bank achieve its inflation target in the short run may be making it more difficult to attain its target in the longer run,.
13628 13628 Whatever is necessary needs to be done but if unity is not there, then still we have to move on,.
13630 13630 It could be an ICC in the Hague,.
13637 13637 If we could abolish the consumption of skunk, we would have 30 % fewer patients,.
13638 13638 It is surprising that Congi and Commie leaders are attacking the transfer of Judge Muralidhar. The decision was endorsed by the Judges Collegium of the Supreme Court. If politicians are free to comment, then it is open to other politicians to comment too.
13640 13640 All that we can say is, the BJP government has has acted,.
13642 13642 Phase out gasoline and diesel in transportation as fast as you can.
13649 13649 As a management we think there 's a case for limited and incremental expansion into sub-Saharan Africa and we be will putting that case to our shareholders,.
13651 13651 I do n't think the conditions are partially ripe for aggressive increases in prices,.
13652 13652 The economy can rebound and some of the shortfalls you are talking about may not be as bad.
13653 13653 I think the possibility of a lockdown of the Tokyo metropolitan area is rising,.
13654 13654 So the risk, if there is one, does not come from the supplied air,.
13656 13656 We are likely at an inflection point where Fear' - driven purchases will begin to dominate liquidity-driven selling pressure as it did in November 2008. As such, both the near-term and long-term gold outlook are looking far more constructive, and we are increasingly confident in our 12-month target of $ 1800/toz.
13660 13660 more likely stabilizes in the current price range.
13662 13662 There 's no contamination of radioactive [ material ] at the nuclear facility. Management [ at the reactor ] has been very good, so there 's no way any contamination can find a way to another area, because it 's quite far,.
13663 13663 Before the global financial crisis, we had no idea how long it would last. But with biological crises, we have got a path and that is the vaccine and then we have some clarity as to when the end will occur.
13666 13666 In most cases the study found that evicted tenants owed one month or less in rent,.
13667 13667 I do n't think anybody that votes ` no' can claim that they are doing everything in their power to prevent what will be -- if the [ big business tax ] ban passes -- an historic betrayal of Seattle and the state 's working people.
13669 13669 It 's shameful that while big business has license to run amok trying to bully or buy politicians-just look at our last election cycle-working people have to follow the most onerous of restrictions.
13670 13670 On the commercial side farmers big and small will need to embrace a change in techniques and learn new things. Traditional knowledge is of course still important and practitioners should find a way to create synergy between old and new techniques to get the best out of them,.
13672 13672 These MoUs establish cooperation to support Estonia with developed know-how and capacity on SMR deployment project so that nuclear energy can give strong contribution into achieving EU carbon neutrality in 2050,.
13673 13673 they would avoid all other older adults.
13676 13676 It is likely that we will see community transmission in the next coming weeks. We need to minimise the impact right across the health and social care sector.
13680 13680 If we reduce carbon emissions in Britain but simply close down our large industries and import the stuff from China instead, then global warming will be worse off,.
13684 13684 Ideally you want all those small and medium-sized businesses that were solvent and doing a great job as of February 1 to still be around and able to do business when folks can get back to work,.
13690 13690 The sooner we receive notification of funding commitments, the sooner we can accelerate testing,.
13698 13698 There is a bigger problem in Australia and the problem is our economy is not doing as well as we 'd like to think,.
13699 13699 There is very little recourse if you go sail and then you get coronavirus due to cruise lines' negligence or recklessness,.
13701 13701 Evidence that the creation of a common currency would contribute greatly to the integration of the real economy ( and vice-versa ) is thus weak. However, the creation of the euro clearly had an impact on cross-border financial activity. The conclusion I put forward is thus that ` one money' fostered cross-border financial activity much more than trade. The euro made a real difference in terms of financial market integration.
13708 13708 Morrison deliberately misquoted data at the UN, to say we are reducing emissions when the data says that we are not ... that we are going to achieve our Paris commitments ` in a canter' when you can only do that if carry over all your Kyoto credits,.
13710 13710 The Fund, which receives all revenue related to oil activity, can not be used to support recurrent expenditure.
13713 13713 As the Trump plan does not seem to generate negotiations-but [ to ] potentially enhance the political conflict between the Palestinians and Israel, as well as between Israel and Jordan - there is no reason to think that it will have an economic positive impact [ for Israel ] in the short run,.
13714 13714 Does this mean that we will honour our sports heroes only if they are acceptable to the Chinese Communist Party ?.
13716 13716 If her arms were an ocean, she 'd reach out vast and deep,.
13720 13720 And it should not be a one-off exercise, but done regularly.
13725 13725 Demand for the program could easily exceed $ 1 trillion,.
13726 13726 If the coronavirus does keep workers at home and workplaces shut down -- and, to be clear, there is no real evidence to suggest that it is hurting the economy at this point -- then that supply-side disruption will end up reducing aggregate demand. Rate cuts alone wo n't be enough to increase it. Fiscal stimulus measures will be required as well.
13730 13730 I could have been infected in the four days before that,.
13731 13731 If it 's not coming, it creates anxiety.
13732 13732 If you are lucky enough to have had access to good education and training in skills from your employer, then you 're much, much better off [ in today 's economy ] than you were before,.
13733 13733 It 's possible people might one day call this the Greater Depression,.
13738 13738 the likely result would be not just depression but a complete breakdown ....
13741 13741 just a matter of the laws of nature or the laws of economics, but in large measure, it 's the result of our man-made policies and laws,.
13743 13743 There is a lot to be admired about a middle-income person who lives his or her life with dignity, and takes care of his or her family,.
13745 13745 If we want to invest in human capital then we need to invest extensively and consistently in the education sector, from preschool to higher education.
13746 13746 Our trustees will be evaluating which ones should go on our list of exclusions.
13747 13747 We are absolutely determined to have a new nuclear power unit ; it is an immutable fact that can not be reversed, even by a millimetre,.
13748 13748 We are with the Kamal Nath government and we will continue to support it. No offer to switch sides was made to us. We are honestly with Kamal Nath, if his government faces any threat it is from some Congress leaders and not us,.
13749 13749 I think there 'll be a one-off European solution that, out of solidarity, amounts to a ` gift' that will be mutualized across the member states,.
13758 13758 In terms of scenarios, the more most likely scenario we now view is a V-shaped impact. In other words, sharp decline in economic activities in China, followed by a rapid recovery and a total impact on China relatively contained. Therefore, impact on the world economy is also contained,.
13770 13770 We have a couple of full time staff that are going to have to be put off if we do n't get any news as to how long this might last for.
13771 13771 There are things that we could do on the structural side ... to have a lower level of housing prices relative to income.
13772 13772 Australia 's unemployment rate rose to 5.3 % in January, from 5.1 % in December, whilst underemployment rose to 8.6 %, the highest since January 2018. The RBA had previously said that monetary easing would continue if the unemployment rate trended up.
13776 13776 If they need to raise their price point ... just to cover the cost of their cup, they can. But other competitors like Coffee Time, or Dunkin ’ Donuts, or Tim Hortons ca n't do it.
13778 13778 The Fed is doing everything they can to try to reduce this crisis,.
13787 13787 It may also prevent the companies that host those ads from maximising their advertising revenue.
13789 13789 People looking for the best rates should also consider the prices available from independent car parks near the airport,.
13790 13790 Why is it that a recalcitrant Bush would do more for HBCUs than an ostensibly sympathetic Obama would ?.
13791 13791 As many of you know there is certain evidence I would like to have seen led in this trial but for a variety of reasons we were n't able to do so,.
13792 13792 Neither party were naked but in a state of partial undress, in terms of buttons or whatever,.
13794 13794 I 'd like to thank my brilliant legal team who are absolutely exceptional. I 'd like to thank all of the people who have sent so many messages over the last 18 months or so but particularly in recent days.
13795 13795 Get ready. Make sure we have everything that the people need. This is why I said food and education are very important. We have to take care of our children and their future. We must plan ( everything ) now,.
13796 13796 If that 's the case, that 's good news,.
13800 13800 Unfortunately, it 's been on a steady slowdown for the last 18 months or so.
13806 13806 Mate that needs to go ahead or they 'll be trouble.
13813 13813 While carefully circumscribed independence is highly effective in delivering price and financial stability, it can not deliver lasting prosperity and it can not address broader societal challenges.
13820 13820 We should be providing some stimulus to bring the UK economy back to the trend rate of growth,.
13822 13822 The research papers on plain packages shows that 81 % of smokers think about quitting at least once a day, and 70 % find cigarettes less satisfying, while 66 % think that the cigarettes have suffered a drop in quality,.
13826 13826 If it were to warm by 6 ° C degrees in a century -- it will not -- you have about 100 years to upgrade Melbourne 's air-conditioning, drainage, etc, to Perth standards. That costs money, but it wo n't ruin the economy.
13829 13829 Almost seven years ago, I wrote in Lean In that in a truly equal world, women would run half our countries and companies and men would run half our homes,.
13830 13830 We still have a lot of work to do and I would love to see some more urgency in fanning that hopeful flame a little bit more because we still have a long way to go.
13831 13831 For someone to say a woman is yelling, you have to raise your voice or sound tense. It 's a very different thing.
13832 13832 Many women who want to marry their boyfriends are nervous to say so. They do n't hand the reins of their educations or careers to someone else -- but they wait for their boyfriends to make this huge decision for them,.
13833 13833 We 've listened to small businesses to understand how we can best help them. We 've heard loud and clear that financial support could enable them to keep the lights on and pay people who ca n't come to work.
13835 13835 brewing for a decade or more.
13840 13840 You 're intervening with people who are, by definition, in unusually poor health or who accrue unusually high healthcare costs. That 's what triggers the intervention,.
13842 13842 This is unfortunately an example of a politician proposing a policy to benefit those who already have more than most at the expense of poor and working class people with really no data or evidence to support it,.
13843 13843 We need the city to act urgently to prevent what could potentially be thousands of working families facing eviction, bankruptcy, or both.
13851 13851 I would not like to see that happen this time.
13852 13852 there are tens of millions of people who do need money that would get it, or would need money later.
13853 13853 Given that we 're in this cutthroat, Wild West environment I think it 's very smart to set up our own system.
13857 13857 symbolic representations provide individuals access to an emotional and symbolic reality that allows us to better understand the experiences of the Shoah and provide it with meaning that can address our urgent present.
13861 13861 If significant vulnerabilities are present, the effects of those shocks on the economy and the financial system can be magnified,.
13864 13864 When the stress test was brought in, it was brand new, it was put in a time when interest rates were really low. And anybody who 's been doing financial regulation long enough knows that as you see these things at play, you realize that maybe there are some desirable tweaks that could be made.
13865 13865 While the ( coronavirus ) effect should not be significant enough to trigger a broader economic malaise, but could this finally push Governor Poloz over the line to proactively stimulate the economy in his next rate call ?.
13866 13866 As far as I can tell there 's high productivity everywhere in Canada except in the statistics,.
13872 13872 Very often, when we face a crisis, it 's a crisis which is only affecting one or two, or a limited number of nations, and then the other nations can provide support,.
13874 13874 We need to go heavy in and train. Build everything from the ministry of defence, institutions, command and control, to train forces. NATO can do that. We already do it, but we can scale up,.
13881 13881 If you want 10 % growth rate, the investment rate to the GDP should be 37 % and 3.7 % should be your efficiency factor and not 5 % as it is today. Efficiency in use of capital should be the objective,.
13882 13882 serious crisis or crash.
13886 13886 I think this is one of the biggest meetings that we have as UN in Africa. Essentially we bring together all of the UN family and all of the member States to talk about the SDGs,.
13888 13888 To solve the problems in low-income countries, where the problems are greatest, you need to apply the simple and cheap solutions that already exist. In high-income countries, all known methods must be applied -- it 's as simple as that,.
13892 13892 In terms of preparedness, farmers are now getting ready for winter wheat planting. Harvesting of cereals and legumes like maize and soya bean planted in the summer season begins from mid-March to end of April, and land preparation for winter wheat should be happening in the process,.
13897 13897 Like in a war or a political crisis, there is continued severe uncertainty about the intensity of the duration and intensity of the shock,.
13899 13899 These measures can help avoid an even more severe and protracted slump in activity and set the stage for economic recovery.
13901 13901 I will start by saying that countries that do n't have a very strong healthcare system should invest in that ... That is needed regardless but this crisis has highlighted the importance of it.
13902 13902 Now, Morrison could do this on the basis that, ` well, look ... in terms of the pandemic, we got caught short and I 'm not going to get caught short anymore', and they can try and bury his past on bushfires and droughts and so on,.
13907 13907 When I see some declarations by some heads of government of other western European countries or the United States I 'm amazed by the combination of slowness and wrong tonalities,.
13912 13912 The central bank is correct to conclude that there is little evidence of demand pressure elsewhere in the economy, and private-sector credit growth can certainly use the boost from this modest rate cut,.
13913 13913 The earnings growth in that group could be very high, because that 's where we 've seen some of the highest income growth over the past 30 years,.
13914 13914 Project management skills, for example, are going to come in handy whether you 're a hospitality worker affected by the downturn in travel, a construction worker whose project has been suspended, or a manufacturing worker whose plant is idle. Another way to track this is to look at job postings from leading-edge companies in your field : what skills have they been seeking as they hire ? That 's a good indication of skills that will give you a competitive edge in regaining employment and moving up.
13917 13917 We do n't want the fact that the game is not being played in China to in any way diminish or reduce the relationship that the AFL, [ clubs and government ] has started to build up with China 's community, so we 're going to make this game a real celebration.
13920 13920 I think we have to open up again in some way, because otherwise the collateral damage is going to be incredible.
13921 13921 You should compare the current situation to the 2003 Sars impact or the post-Lehman crisis of 2008. The Sars situation was more transparent ... a lot was revealed. The trouble this time is that China has a firewall and the information flow has not been good.
13924 13924 Our amenities and offerings have been updated to reflect the guidance of the CDC, The World Health Organization, and our local health authorities. For example, our only food and beverage options at present are ` to-go' options that a guest could enjoy in their hotel room,.
13926 13926 This might seem odd, given that Boeing reported zero orders in January,.
13928 13928 It will rise above that level, though, as job losses appear to be continuing at an astonishingly rapid pace.
13929 13929 Rate cuts wo n't prevent the economic hit from supply chain disruption or demand compression as a result of the virus. But they would make it cheaper for businesses to finance the extra working capital to carry them through a period of weaker demand.
13930 13930 They should be doing much more than they are thinking about and doing it much quicker, at least $ 2 trillion with the promise of more to come,.
13931 13931 Looking at the states' unemployment numbers that I 've been coming out of the last few days it looks to me like the order of magnitude of the state seems to be about 10 times higher than the normal weekly number before the crisis. So that means that next week 's job claims number could jump from 200 and something thousand this week to 2 million next week,.
13935 13935 Across the country there are fewer and fewer places with lower-priced homes combined with good job prospects, and that is a fundamental reason why Americans are moving at the lowest rates in our history. Even low mortgage rates can not make homes affordable for millions,.
13943 13943 The sharp decline in the oil market may well undermine clean energy transitions by reducing the impetus for energy efficiency policies,.
13944 13944 We urge you to do better. We fully understand that the IEA does not intend to define policy or investment decisions, but the fact is that the WEO is the globally authoritative publication on energy and energy infrastructure and it is used to inform significant investment and political decisions worldwide. As the WEO can become a self fulfilling prophecy, it carries a major responsibility that goes way beyond that of other publications that are merely descriptive. The IEA can not be derelict of this responsibility.
13946 13946 You could make a list of the 100 most prominent economists in the world, and Peter Navarro would n't be on it. His views are very, very far from the mainstream.
13948 13948 Anything you can do to help your heart. Exercise and eating well are massively more important than the more obscure ways people worry about dying.
13951 13951 I do n't think it 's really our business to change the regime.
13954 13954 We want to think about it as Harvard is really growing as a campus, not just that SEAS is moving away,.
13959 13959 With fewer listings in what 's already a housing shortage environment, home prices are likely to hold steady. The temporary softening of the real estate market will likely be followed by a strong rebound once the economic ` quarantine' is lifted, and it 's critical that supply is sufficient to meet pent-up demand.
13961 13961 With fewer listings in what 's already a housing shortage environment, home prices are likely to hold steady.
13963 13963 The trend line for housing starts is increasing and showing steady improvement, which should ultimately lead to more home sales,.
13966 13966 Please, please raise my taxes. Wealthy people like me should commit to reducing the ravages of economic inequality.
13967 13967 President Trump expressed the view that he might consider to remove the chair who did not follow the policies that he thought most desirable,.
13971 13971 We still can do everything we need to do to fight this recession,.
13974 13974 You know what spreads faster than any virus ? Fear / And when it comes to fear, you can either forget everything and run, or you can face everything and rise,.
13977 13977 Over a dozen cases of inflight transmission of serious infections have been documented, and air travel can serve as a conduit for the rapid spread of newly emerging infections and pandemics. Despite sensational media stories, risks of transmission of respiratory viruses in an airplane cabin are unknown. Movements of passengers and crew may facilitate disease transmission.
13981 13981 It is likely that we will not perform well in PISA. We said this months before, during the budget hearings,.
13982 13982 as he evolved, as he achieved and as he stumbled. Walt Whitman may well have had someone like this mercurial pheno-Menon in mind when he wrote his famous line' I am large, I contain multitudes',.
13985 13985 In the last five months, no meaningful political activity has taken place in Jammu and Kashmir. The Congress party wants that meaningful political activities start in Jammu and Kashmir immediately. Political tourism of taking envoys to Jammu and Kashmir should stop,.
13987 13987 My guess is that extracting from the vagaries of this data, and it goes beyond weather, underlying job growth is probably somewhere around half the size of the January gain, probably around 150,000 jobs.
13988 13988 If I had to put a number on it, I 'd say there 's about a 60 per cent probability of recession at this point.
13989 13989 We know it 's a problem if we do n't do something about it. We do n't know precisely when it will be a problem or how it will manifest itself. It 's a big deal. It 's just not a big deal today.
13991 13991 If we actually go into recession and this is in fact a pandemic, the Fed will run out of room very quickly.
13992 13992 Especially in an election year, I do n't think there 's [ much of a ] chance they 'll take a hard line.
13994 13994 Social innovators have pioneered sustainable approaches and inclusive business models, and serve as a clear demonstration that models of stakeholder capitalism can indeed work,.
13999 13999 We could usefully have that flexibility to allow, for example, Scotland and Wales to have some influence over who they take in as well as the country as a whole.
14002 14002 He 's a trooper. If he could play, you know he 'd be playing, so I think we just give him a few days of rest and see what happens.
14007 14007 One could imagine a world in the next few months where everyone is tested and all but the immune compromised go back to a socially distanced but more normal life. We wear bracelets or carry a phone certificate which indicate our status, and track infections where they emerge,.
14010 14010 so the specific nature of the storm when it hits an area is likely to matter. [ But ] our results suggest that, on average, there is no difference.
14011 14011 Rebecca Long-Bailey would be a catastrophe for Labour.
14012 14012 The BoE gave us a taste of what could happen. We 're expecting something major from the ECB.
14013 14013 Short-term rates in the UK fell on the comments. Second, UK retail sales over the holidays seemed to be boosted by discounts, and share prices of the UK 's largest retailers are under pressure today. Third, the fear that the UK-EU negotiations could fail to reach an agreement.
14017 14017 Certainly having people get free tests, for example, if they want to, or possibly finding ways to make it easier to call in sick might be a short-term solution [ and among the ] kinds of things to government can spend money on.
14019 14019 I can not emphasize enough : No.
14020 14020 Milk is a vegetarian diet in India. The demand of US administration is that India should remove the condition that only the milk of vegetarian cows be imported from US. Since, in the US, cows are fed with blood and meat, and import of milk from such cows is prohibited in India.
14021 14021 Officials must prepare a comprehensive spending plan,.
14025 14025 The Eurasian Economic Commission has prepared a whole package of measures to fight the coronavirus and support the economy in these difficult conditions. It is important that these measures should be taken promptly and should involve all the spheres where work has to be stepped up,.
14027 14027 2020 is a momentous year for Thames Hospice as we move from our current home in Windsor to our new hospice by Bray Lake. Be a part of our journey and join us on this adventure to raise funds for your local hospice, so we can care for even more local families now and into the future.
14028 14028 A perceived lack of ... solidarity could jeopardize the long-term cohesion of the EU and the Eurozone,.
14032 14032 Now, if you understand how that market is configured today, getting an existing licence would have taken a lot longer.
14034 14034 We thought this was the right thing to do for the franchise.
14036 14036 What will be your answer if a question about it is raised at the FATF meeting ? What kind of a state we are running ?.
14041 14041 the gain in the capacity to act could be smaller than hoped. A strong increase in the goal could raise risks that inflation expectations become deanchored,.
14043 14043 I 've got a lot of work to do on the reforms to the FAI and I would prefer to see those implemented before a general election. So I would have a preference for an April/May date, but obviously that 's not in my hands.
14045 14045 On behalf of the Board and the Association, I would like to thank all our partners for their support and their commitment to the future of our game and we look forward to working with them, our staff and our stakeholders to bring this plan to fruition.
14046 14046 Tom and I were always fascinated by Shackleton as a leader and his contagious optimism and absolute belief in his team. At a time where leaders seem to be more about self than society, Shackleton sacrificed his own needs to ensure the wellbeing of his team -- thats inspirational.
14049 14049 The answer is simple : We believe that Hollub, Batchelder and the rest of the Board were fearful that OXY would be acquired,.
14053 14053 As a result of his political role he will have known my movements for campaign events such as hustings as well as the count. My office had to inform the police about any event he might be present at, including the general election count, as we had no idea whether or what kind of threat he might pose,.
14064 14064 We acknowledged that the sheer scale of demand destruction ( about 25 % -30 % of global demand ) would require unprecedented production cuts to balance the market,.
14065 14065 The easing cycle is ... close to an end and central bankers can take comfort that their limited and unconventional toolbox proved effective in cushioning a substantial shock,.
14066 14066 At the end of the year, you may well have a payroll that is earned within hours before midnight Dec. 31 but wo n't be paid until the first paycheck in January. If you accrue payroll, then you calculate the expense that will be incurred for those December hours, and add that as an expense to your tax deductions and income statement even though you have not paid out cash.
14068 14068 If China had an impact on U.S. trade, European restrictions will have a bigger impact because Europe and the U.S. are much bigger trade partners,.
14069 14069 It looks like the exit will be less ` V-shaped' than one would want. And the question, how long is the bottom of the ` U', I do n't have an answer for that,.
14071 14071 Trump has no intellectual or personal issues with Powell -- he just finds him to be a convenient target,.
14072 14072 We issued a restock notice as, in our view, no exemption applied and a felling permission should have been acquired. Our decision is being appealed by the landowner.
14073 14073 Without the intervention of a catalyst, the existing set of fragmented connections would have stayed the same for another 30 years. But once the inclusive growth ecosystem has been set up, it can be self-sustaining.
14086 14086 We should be proud of Reza Baqir who studied in the best American universities after completing his studies in Lahore.
14089 14089 But our long-term response must tackle habitat and biodiversity loss,.
14090 14090 [ o ] ur collective failure to act strongly and early means that we must now implement deep and urgent cuts ... This report gives us a stark choice : set in motion the radical transformations we need now, or face the consequences of a planet radically altered by climate change.
14097 14097 I opposed Brexit but I have now reached the conclusion that the British did the right thing, even if they did it for the wrong reason.
14107 14107 If you look at the business cycle phenomena in India, typically if you look at the peaks and troughs and co-relate it with what has happened, it seems like we have hit the trough therefore there should be uptick in growth,.
14111 14111 The complicated structure makes it harder, undoubtedly. But let 's do what we can,.
14115 14115 Of course, Scooter never contacted me or my team to discuss it [ acquiring my masters ] prior to the sale or even when it was announced,.
14118 14118 who promised three months ago to repay a $ 10,000 campaign donation that violated the board 's ethics policy, has not yet refunded the money and is likely to be replaced as Virginia 's representative on the regional board. Dorsey said Wednesday that he is working on a wire transfer to return the money to a transit union that routinely negotiates with Metro.
14121 14121 I would like to see India as a strong component of the global alliance of democracies. I appreciate very much the leadership of Prime Minister Modi in that respect. I hope we could engage India much more internationally in the coming years,.
14122 14122 should be open to reassessing their view of the economy based on all incoming information, including the views of participants in the financial markets,.
14125 14125 the consumer behavior and policy decisions are likely to produce a decline in GDP that may very well last 2 calendar quarters or longer,.
14126 14126 I do not think economic gains have been any faster or better under Trump than gains we would have forecast based on the steady improvements we saw in the economy and job market in President Obama 's second term,.
14128 14128 I feel like the majority of my classes, I can learn out of a textbook. That 's how I learn better anyway. But one of my fellow students said, ` I 'm a better hands-on learner,' and I was thinking ... ( some ) learning is better in class. Those teaching moments are n't going to be the same when I 'm on the computer.
14131 14131 Our expectation is that we could attract about $ 3billion, the same level as remittances currently in a period of a year or two,.
14137 14137 I do n't know if I could have forgiven myself if we would have lost -- being late to the game,.
14138 14138 If you put two together, as there are many other heads, the amount will be close to about Rs 1 lakh crore,.
14141 14141 We have benefitted from a tight and stable board since the IPO in December 2013, with no change in chairman, chief executive officer or chief financial officer and this board has proven to be an engine for growth.
14144 14144 could be initiated when necessary.
14147 14147 Not at all. Why would anybody be worried about it ?.
14149 14149 would seem to fly in the face of rational rulemaking,.
14151 14151 It is no surprise that I, and many Democrats and a growing number of Republicans, too, think that we need to act with a sense of urgency to address climate change,.
14154 14154 Every state across America can produce a complete checkbook of public expenditures,.
14155 14155 People in financial markets can obtain high returns if they can predict recessions but they are not able to do it -- at least not better than anyone else. They can not anticipate the timing of recessions and they price the risk of one only once they see it,.
14156 14156 We could also reduce rates and charges for the SMEs and the poor by lowering fees and charges, utility rates and more subsidies and loans to SMEs,.
14158 14158 All the other big shots in the world have to buy armored Mercedes or Rolls Royces or BMWs. The American President travels with his own luxury war machine, like a little White House on wheels,.
14163 14163 Automotive is a crucial sector, especially with the change from industrial combustion engine to electric car or hydrogen car, and Mier will certainly support the policy,.
14175 14175 It 's probably going to just continue to rise exponentially for a couple of weeks,.
14177 14177 could stall its climb.
14179 14179 If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia holds open the prospect of further key rate reduction at its upcoming meetings,.
14181 14181 did not observe any material or substantive impediments inside the tabulation room, which might have prevented the resumption of the tabulation process.
14182 14182 I revealed a very bullish posture intermediate-term since October when Powell guaranteed he would not rescind the insurance [ rate ] cuts unless inflation was persistently above target,.
14184 14184 The amygdala [ part of the brain ] is going off, saying, ` Do what you can to protect your family.' It makes us irrational and selfish and it 's hard to get a larger view.
14186 14186 The differences between the long-run effects of forced labor in Peru and Java suggest that for understanding persistent impacts on economic activity, we need to know more than just whether there was forced labor in a location,.
14187 14187 The first rule of virus economics is that you got ta stop the virus before you can do anything about the economics,.
14190 14190 Both the U.S. and California economies are likely to fall into a recession if they 're not already in one,.
14193 14193 I do n't think this is a good thing. This is a bad thing. They are fearmongering through the app.
14196 14196 What we do foresee is a change in some of the core materials that we 're using. We want to develop new materials which are biodegradable that can substitute the present materials.
14198 14198 Congress will always find the funds to accomplish the things that it considers a priority. If that 's tax cuts, then that 's the priority, and the money will be there. If it 's wars, that 's the priority. If it 's dealing with a global pandemic, then that suddenly becomes a priority.
14201 14201 to do what we thought, er, Larry thought was an IT transformation.
14203 14203 I would n't say go looking at science fiction, but looking at futurists I think we could do a lot more,.
14208 14208 How to Think About the Lockdown Decision in Latin America,.
14210 14210 I would attribute that to the incredibly low mortgage rates and the steady release of a sizable pent-up housing demand that was built over recent years,.
14217 14217 My left arm was underneath ( the complainer ), my right arm was around ( her ) and both her feet were still on the floor. It was not a comfortable or easy position to be in. We were side by side and we were both fully dressed.
14219 14219 that he would make no further public comment on these matters until after the coronavirus crisis was over.
14222 14222 These are all public places. It would be insane to do anything like that. These claims are a fabrication.
14228 14228 Our voice needs to be heard. It 's an interesting time. Hopefully, we can get his done. If you asked me, it is a pretty good deal. It is. Is it a perfect deal, no .. But I 'm hard-pressed to find such a thing as the perfect deal.
14231 14231 The geo-political effects of the pandemic could be significant,.
14237 14237 We have no reason to not believe the reports we have seen from different NATO allies ... that the plane may have been downed by Iranian air defence systems,.
14246 14246 This crisis is like no other. First, the shock is large. The output loss associated with this health emergency and related containment measures likely dwarfs the losses that triggered the global financial crisis.
14249 14249 If you look at the numbers which came out of the first quarters of the fiscal year 2019, they were weaker than we had anticipated last October and so, if you take those numbers into account and if you look at the weakness in credit growth in India, that is factored into our forecast for 2019 and 2020,.
14251 14251 At this point, the RBI should take a cue from central banks across the world who are contributing by easing liquidity. Liquidity should not be a constraint. But we need to think carefully as we have large NPAs,.
14256 14256 I think Modi has one problem with me. Not only I am an economist but also a politician.
14257 14257 You seem to have missed that he is the only PM to have restored & reopened Hindu temples in Pakistan and also opened Kartarpur for Sikhs. Our PM has full right to expose the truth about what is happening in India because you guys beat up those who speak up inside India,.
14258 14258 Why Bengal should be so possessive ?.
14263 14263 IEA analysis shows that governments directly or indirectly drive more than 70 % of global energy investments. They have a historic opportunity today to steer those investments onto a more sustainable path,.
14267 14267 perhaps the worst time in its history, and this could have major implications for the global economy, financial markets, and even more for employment.
14269 14269 Despite widespread expectations global energy-related CO2 emissions would post another annual increase in 2019, new @ IEA data shows they were unchanged at 33 gigatonnes even as the world economy expanded by 2.9 [ percent ],.
14273 14273 If you 're in a window, there 's obviously no two seats on one side of you. And so you 've cut down that zone of risk by actually six people -- because the people in front of them and behind them.

14287 14287 Africa may lose half of its GDP with growth falling from 3.2 per cent to about two per cent due to a number of reasons which include the disruption of global supply chains.
14288 14288 The UN will remain open to deliver as one. Victory for us is that no UN staff gets infected or gets sick, and if they do that it does n't spread into the community,.
14291 14291 But if you ca n't talk to your boyfriend about marriage, you 're either dating the wrong person or you 're not giving him credit for being the right person.
14297 14297 These are things that a lot of regular people would do and were showing you how much of tax savings that could amount to,.
14298 14298 If the administration makes available extra resources, because of the interpretation of the public charge concept, many people may be reluctant to accept those funds,.
14299 14299 If there were to be a deeper downturn, [ that requires ] more stimulus than a conventional recession, then it 's not clear that monetary policy would have sufficient space,.
14300 14300 We had it at the time of the referendum as we were told the most terrible things would happen if we voted to leave the European Union and of course, nothing of the sort happened.
14302 14302 We 're not picking that up yet at all in the European and UK economic indicators, but if the world is slower than the UK, a very open economy, will have an impact,.
14303 14303 Although the magnitude of the economic shock from coronavirus is highly uncertain, activity is likely to weaken materially in the UK over the coming months.
14307 14307 would vote in favor of a looser monetary policy during the late-January meeting.
14324 14324 It was that sense of the creative side of economics that could work on a virtually unlimited canvas and try to make sense of any problem that you thought was important -- that was the part that was so exciting to me,.
14326 14326 They say, ` Well, there are a whole bunch of projects -- a whole bunch of government spending that helps old people. I want mine. If we 're going to spend a huge amount on Medicare, why are n't we spending a whole lot on education for me ?'.
14337 14337 The Fed rate cut gives the PBOC more leeway to cut rates in China without prompting excessive capital outflows, therefore making a Chinese rate cut more likely,.
14340 14340 It is now clear that we have entered a recession as bad, or worse than in 2009. We do project recovery in 2021,.
14343 14343 The global economy is now in a recession -- a period of economic decline where output falls for two successive quarters -- that could be as bad or worse than the 2009 downturn.
14347 14347 The apparent ceasefire in the battle over tariffs removes a downside risk to growth. But tariffs remain high and we suspect that tensions will persist in other forms, adding to reasons to expect the global economic recovery to be a gradual one,.
14348 14348 And obviously we would prioritize countries, especially countries in Africa, that have already been faced with difficulties.
14349 14349 First, the outlook for global growth : for 2020 it is negative -- a recession at least as bad as during the global financial crisis or worse,.
14350 14350 For low-income countries, we have rapid-disbursing emergency financing of up to USD 10 billion ( 50 per cent of quota of eligible members ) that can be accessed without a full-fledged IMF programme,.
14355 14355 We will not ask to extend the transition period, and if the EU asks we will say ` no.' Extending the transition would simply prolong the negotiations, prolong business uncertainty and delay the moment of control of our borders. It would also keep us bound by EU legislation at a point when we need legislative and economic flexibility to manage the U.K. response to the coronavirus pandemic,.
14356 14356 We strongly welcome the decision of the G20 to respond to our call to allow the poorest countries of the world that request forbearance to suspend repayment of official bilateral credit on May 1,.
14361 14361 There is no question that 2020 will be exceptionally difficult. If the pandemic fades in the second half of the year -- thus allowing a gradual lifting of containment measures and reopening of the economy -- our baseline assumption is for a partial recovery in 2021. But again, I stress there is tremendous uncertainty around the outlook : it could get worse depending on many variable factors, including the duration of the pandemic.
14362 14362 The way in which the EU and the eurozone are perceived to react to the unprecedented emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic can shape attitudes to European integration for decades to come.
14364 14364 This blurring could call into question the RBA 's independence, but we believe this form of QE would likely be highly effective.
14367 14367 Australians should feel proud of our banknotes,.
14368 14368 outbreak overseas is having a significant effect on the Australian economy at present, particularly in the education and travel sectors. The uncertainty that it is creating is also likely to affect domestic spending.
14371 14371 We 've got to take that into account in thinking about spending.
14372 14372 He is concerned that lowering rates might lead to a pick-up in already high household debt, creating a longer-term vulnerability for the economy,.
14376 14376 What I would like to see is business and governments use the opportunity of record-low interest rates -- and we are going to be in this world of low interest rates for a long period of time -- to use that opportunity for investments in areas like infrastructure, human capital, energy production and data science,.
14384 14384 I think the only thing they are a bit light on is the household payments.
14386 14386 I think very quickly we can talk about over a million jobs being lost. It looks like we are going to get through that in very short order,.
14391 14391 I think you have to make the colleges a very central part of this.
14396 14396 We are still optimistic that the [ Trump ] administration will be able to get this virus under control and reopen the economy by the end of April, early May,.
14399 14399 If Buffett will do it, I do n't think the Treasury secretary should,.
14400 14400 Do we risk sort of dragging this out and really crushing capitalism if we ca n't fix it now and then move on and have it behind us ? Yes. So the president is right.
14401 14401 Given the pullback in consumer demand in travel and entertainment, the actual boost to household purchasing power from falling oil prices could be less than usual,.
14404 14404 I just do n't know which equation I should be putting this in,.
14405 14405 it would not be a cut against a hypothetical or a possibility.
14407 14407 The Canadian economy has demonstrated good resilience in the past couple of years. That resilience could be seriously tested by COVID-19, however, depending on the severity and duration of its effects,.
14408 14408 Many of the narratives about monetary policy can not withstand careful analysis,.
14413 14413 Business leaders now have an incredible opportunity ... They can bring the world closer to achieving shared goals, such as those outlined in the Paris climate agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda. If they really want to leave their mark on the world, there is no alternative.
14414 14414 Pull your ears in for a year or two. Reduce the strain on your portfolio due to withdrawals. That will give you an extra measure of comfort. Most people do that naturally, anyway.
14418 14418 We are not facing very difficult situation right now and lets hope that we do not get into that stage in future and there is no such situation that will have very bad affect on our economy or our country.
14419 14419 There would a reduction in the prices of fertilisers and we will also help subsidise through other ways,.
14422 14422 whose circumstances would prevent them from leaving campus due to international travel restrictions or other extraordinary circumstances.
14428 14428 delegates in Philadelphia expected states would put forward a variety of candidates ; none would win a national majority in the electoral college ; and the election would typically pass to the House of Representatives.
14430 14430 People know who I am. I am extraordinary but I can also be a bit of a knob-I know all of that.
14431 14431 It is gon na happen, believe you me -- it 's gon na happen very f * * * ing soon because he 's greedy and he loves money and he knows that it 's got to happen soon or it wo n't happen.
14432 14432 Noel lost the plot and kicked off with Liam, think you all know the story. Studio trashed, baseball bats on heads. Air rifles locked in cupboards to save deaths. Dustbins thrown through the hire car windows. Band split up. new drummer in bits. Think Liam ended up with a broken arm.
14433 14433 But if it does happen, it 'll be 50/50, believe you me.
14434 14434 Well Noel would do anything for a photograph, wo n't he ? Trying to break the Internet.
14435 14435 If that can be done, then monetary policy, augmented by the new policy tools, should regain much of its potency.
14437 14437 Low inflation can become a self-perpetuating trap,.
14441 14441 There are a lot of people where, unless they have a qualified Realtor, they might not know what they 're getting into.
14442 14442 Ordinarily, we will have a shock that will raise or lower the demand over several months or maybe a year, but not in a single month,.
14444 14444 In all my years of doing public policy research, I 've never seen a plan where the funding mechanism could impact it this dramatically -- up to a quarter of all GDP within 40 years,.
14445 14445 there are very real constraints on how many students Stanford could admit while still maintaining its quality. These constraints are not arbitrary, but fundamental to Stanford 's ( and its peer institutions' ) method of financing.
14446 14446 To see the lengths that my fellow teammates went to so that I would feel supported and no different than any other employee really shows the human kindness we have for one another,.
14447 14447 After the game I was asked to go down to the dressing room because there was some concern from the playing staff that there might be some action from the police,.
14450 14450 We 're building a bridge until the economy can get to the other side and begin to recover and if that happens sooner we 'll certainly know what to do at that time.
14452 14452 When such an external shock [ such as the coronavirus outbreak ] takes place, it 's important that these interactions decrease, hence isolating elderly people should have immediately been a priority.
14456 14456 It is very difficult to explain to a fish that there is a border whereas you can do that to a human and a lorry driver,.
14459 14459 I have no interest in selling the team. Zero. Got it ? People can write what they want to write. I 'm going to own it until I die.
14463 14463 We could see a significant impact on Europe, which has been weak to start with,.
14469 14469 I can summarize [ the trend ] in one phrase : Drive until you qualify,.
14475 14475 The catalyst comes in and says, we need a corporation to be the anchor for this, and say, if we can get high-quality product coming through, they 'll be happy to buy,.
14476 14476 those getting massively stressed are likely to leave the profession.
14488 14488 You ca n't say ` do n't worry, trust me, we met, but I can tell you what we said,.
14490 14490 Fed data shows that 40 % of US households would not be able to come up with $ 400 for an emergency expense and data from 2019 shows that 53 % of US households do n't have any emergency savings.
14493 14493 It appears that firms have responded immediately, and positively, to the news that the Phase One trade deal would prevent the imposition of further tariffs on consumer goods,.
14503 14503 We believe Oxy is a good company with good assets. We are pleased to have reached this settlement and can now focus on working with Steve Chazen to enhance value for all Oxy stockholders.
14504 14504 We were talking about the coming coronavirus, and what we can do to respond to this. That was the seed for it,.
14505 14505 It might be things as simple as putting out the trash on trash day, if you 're not able to do that, or transport to medical services, and emergency response : check-ins, calling every day and saying, how are you doing ?.
14506 14506 When you look at EMs, some of the important ones may be fragile for some years,.
14509 14509 It does n't matter if you 're young, old, employed, unemployed, student, formerly employed, partially employed, hourly worker, contractor, gig, or small business,.
14510 14510 You can not just copy and paste other 's investment style. Investors should modify the approach and adapt as per their risk appetite,.
14512 14512 But if they are out of work for a long while, then we have to have a different conversation.
14514 14514 If they get the virus under control, then the economy can bounce back quickly, but at the moment, when that will happen is not clear,.
14516 14516 Our advice to the public remains the same. Members of the public who have visited affected regions and have symptoms are advised to self-isolate at home and contact their GP in the first instance. Advice will then be given on next steps, including testing if required.
14522 14522 While the committee would like to see the inflation expectations anchored closer to the midpoint of the inflation target range on a sustained basis, the lower inflation forecast and improved risk profile opens some space to provide further policy accommodation to the economy.
14523 14523 trying to build up financial buffers as a protection against a blow to their income. I think it 's quite likely that saving is going to remain high for many people,.
14524 14524 Now we know there are massive risks over which the Fed has no control. It can mitigate the risk but it ca n't control it.
14527 14527 Improving social mobility must be the fundamental imperative of this new decade : As long as an individual 's chances in life remain disproportionately influenced by their socioeconomic status at birth, inequalities will never be reduced,.
14529 14529 For example, if a company manufactures something that will experience delayed demand, because of the COVID situation,.
14530 14530 If you 're producing non-durable goods, say you 're a restaurant,.
14531 14531 The government can pull the economy out of the slowdown. But two ingredients are essential : recognising the true extent and nature of the problem and instituting reliable data systems for good policy navigation.
14533 14533 They can all learn from the Bank of Japan 's yield curve control. When governments are doing repeated fiscal expansion, this is the least politically fraught and most transparent way to accommodate fiscal policy.
14536 14536 So, the patient in room one who may or may not have COVID-19, but the patient in Room 2 certainly does, well now, you 've exposed all these people unnecessarily,.
14537 14537 But the purely economic effects should n't be overlooked either, as globalist leaders also encouraged the buildup of China as a huge global manufacturing hub, and thereby exposed Americans to the risk of shortages and other supply chain risks in a wide variety of critical products.
14539 14539 If you push them down, what will you gain ? Even in your umunna ( kindred ), the leader is appointed by God and should be allowed to do his work and supported not frustrated.
14541 14541 It means that our growth track is much less than it seems to be.
14543 14543 The Congress has to fight the BJP ... There is a BJP trap and a CPI ( M ) trap, you should avoid both traps,.
14545 14545 As somebody who has been associated with the power sector for almost three decades including as minister, the call to go dark for 9 min at 9 pm on the 5th can have a deep impact on the grid and its stability. I sincerely hope this is being properly managed.
14549 14549 By prominently displaying a hotel offer in ` top position' on its website, Trivago represented that the offer was either the cheapest available offer or had some other extra feature that made it the best offer when this was often not the case.
14550 14550 It 's my view as an economist that if you 're going to tackle air problems, you need to provide financial incentives,.
14553 14553 The coronavirus has been a body blow to the Chinese economy, which now threatens to take out the entire global economy. A global recession is likely if COVID-19 becomes a pandemic, and the odds of that are uncomfortably high and rising with infections surging in Italy and Korea.
14557 14557 Most of those people, even if they do n't lose their jobs, they 're going to lose hours, they 're going to lose pay,.
14565 14565 a huge policy initiative to boost real growth or the luck of a dollar depreciation,.
14566 14566 What could have happened is that farmers got into an indebtedness problem. They kept borrowing in a cycle and probably that has fed into the agricultural sector,.
14568 14568 Either China massively increases imports and reduces current account surplus from the current 1.5 % of GDP, or it engages in trade diversion away from current providers of goods which compete with the U.S.
14581 14581 The distributional effects are worrisome as well : A one-year payroll tax cut of 2 % of income would provide up to a $ 5,508 tax cut to a high-income couple but only $ 500 to a single parent getting by on $ 25,000 a year -- and nothing for a worker placed on leave without pay. This is n't the fairest or most efficient way to increase aggregate demand.
14582 14582 The idea that there 's a trade-off between health and economics right now is likely badly mistaken,.
14583 14583 Who can stand up to him, get down and dirty on the debate stage ?.
14586 14586 If AI is a black box, then people wo n't trust it. In a connected world, however, trust will be essential,.
14588 14588 It may be more money than they expect.
14594 14594 However, someone misinterpreted it all and this is how the media saw it. I would like to ask the deputy prime ministers, the ministers and the heads of services and agencies to make sure that there is a quick response in such situations. People need detailed comments,.
14595 14595 We have a fairly stable [ economic ] situation ... we do have inflation but I think it will not exceed 4 percent, this is obvious.
14599 14599 We can all do our bit by taking a trip to the regions. Whichever way you head in Victoria, you 're bound to discover something to delight in.
14602 14602 The outdoors and parks are pretty much the last place we can go to enjoy our lives at this point. Everything else has been closed, all other entertainment and social outlets. So it 's just so important to have this one place to go and feel normal in a way, and to breathe the fresh air, and clear your mind.
14604 14604 for a time when market functioning had improved and such an action could be expected to be most effective in supporting the economy,.
14607 14607 and then there was an almost throwaway line at the end about what a bright future the Iranians have if they only reshape themselves as the United States demands.
14612 14612 I really enjoy what I do, and I want to do what I can to help others around me be more successful,.
14615 14615 Most of the GDP loss that we saw in the SARS model, and in reality, was China slowing down. And so, with China much bigger, you 'd expect the billions would be much bigger.
14616 14616 If the larger philosophical question is, can we ever tell stories about the Holocaust that are not documentary ? I believe we can and should.
14618 14618 I think he came from the Amblin world -- another word for Spielberg -- so it was all very wondrous and clean.
14620 14620 This will be the lowest growth that developing Asia will have seen in 22 years, or since the Asian financial crisis,.
14625 14625 We are preparing for the ECB tomorrow, which could do something,.
14629 14629 I would proceed very cautiously if at all.
14634 14634 The green bracelet would fade to red every week when it 's time to get tested again.
14636 14636 we put on everything from soundscapes, sound poetry ; we put on all kinds of material, sound documentaries, everything that we thought was new and good for FM radio.
14637 14637 We were handicapped going through the 2007-09 crisis because we could n't have more than three members of the board in the room at one time without announcing a meeting,.
14640 14640 I would like the boards to be asking these questions and trying to ascertain how they are doing to measure the effects of these transactions and what are the consequences for not meeting goals,.
14647 14647 I felt like if I had a teacher of color, or just a good teacher in general, they would have handled that situation extremely differently,.
14650 14650 With investors likely to become increasingly focused on U.S. election risk, and less on risks in Europe and Asia, we think there is a good argument for more geographic diversification,.
14654 14654 The outbreak seems rather severe,.
14655 14655 The U.S. went from having quantitative limits on how much apparel could be imported from a variety of countries to having those limits go away,.
14656 14656 There remains scope for greater collaboration, both within and between sectors, and indeed across this whole city, to refine our strategic thinking about how the sometimes disparate elements of the city economy can be connected more effectively.
14658 14658 While feeding themselves is not a problem to many Chinese nowadays, eating novel food or meat, organs or parts from rare animals or plants has become a measure of identity to some people.
14661 14661 The changes you 're seeing now, with schools closing and gatherings limited, are part of our system of government working exactly the way it should -- to protect people,.
14666 14666 We can try to come together globally and devise an international treaty. Countries may be willing to sign an international treaty in which they promise to reduce their carbon emissions to a safe level,.
14667 14667 We tried this approach during the 2007 recession in the US and let Lehman Brothers go under, and we learnt the unintended consequences. Lehman Brothers had so many interconnections that it impacted the entire financial market ... So we can not leave it to chance.
14670 14670 It also missed an invaluable opportunity to address the toxic combination of mental illness, adolescent psychology, and social media that was at the heart of this suicide case and will likely lead to additional tragedies in the future.
14672 14672 Think of how insidious that is,.
14680 14680 With a westerly wind, which is the prevailing wind direction here, a fire would leap the Princes Highway into Murramarang National Park in minutes, placing small coastal communities and holiday makers at grave risk,.
14682 14682 I was looking forward to the whole experience but there was a lot of unknown that summer when I was going to be held. Not like now with social media or twitter where the news gets out.
14683 14683 if you think about Europe, nobody has closed borders there and for the U.S. to shut the borders is very extreme in my view and it 's trying to send a message.
14686 14686 Steelton High would be down and my brother would get up and start that clap ... clap clap your hands ... and the next thing you know everyone is clapping. That gym would be packed up there. He knew the kids. He would always sit in the front row no matter what, you could tell from those kids that Coach Ed had earned their respect.
14695 14695 If you look, the growth year over year is substantial and here in America, the latest statistics say that it 's somewhere around a $ 10-to - $ 15 billion industry this year. It 's at least that large in China and worldwide, we have to be talking about an industry that 's $ 50 billion or more,.
14696 14696 If you think about things that have changed drastically in the past 20 years in the U.S., the amount of lobbying and campaign spending and the fact that we have a decreasing competition,.
14698 14698 The foggers disperse diluted bleach water, which ensures there would be less microbes on the person,.
14701 14701 With costless market transactions, the decision of the courts concerning liability for damage would be without effect on the allocation of resources.
14703 14703 We can think about the current situation as a crisis or as an opportunity to explore all these and many more new possibilities,.
14704 14704 With Trump 's vision embracing these tenets of Rabin 's, the authors are clearly suggesting that the widely anticipated Palestinian rejection of the plan is unjustifiable.
14709 14709 That 's a big deal. If you look at what happened in 2003 ... stock markets sold off double digits. If you look at the escalation of the reported cases, it feels a lot like that,.
14710 14710 The ramp system is coming out so the concourses can be widened and we can add some replacement club spaces and make the building hopefully a little more modern, so the fans can move around a little more freely,.
14711 14711 We forecast the South Korean economy to manage positive growth this year, but it would be difficult for the rate of growth to reach 1 %,.
14717 14717 So you can indulge yourselves with a study of what it would be like if there were no taxes -- but the reality is unfortunately much harsher.
14723 14723 These new provisions will ensure the rules of this agreement can actually be enforced. That can not be said of previous trade agreements that the Senate has ratified.
14724 14724 This rule will lead to dirtier air at a time when our country is working around the clock to respond to a respiratory pandemic whose effects may be exacerbated by air pollution,.
14727 14727 I believe everyone here today agrees that the Chemical Safety Board must continue to be provided with the resources it needs to do its job,.
14729 14729 With their extensive know-how and deep pockets, oil and gas companies can play a crucial role in accelerating deployment of key renewable options such as offshore wind, while also enabling some key capital-intensive clean energy technologies -- such as hydrogen and CCUS -- to reach maturity,.
14730 14730 transformation of the energy sector can happen without the oil and gas industry, but it would be more difficult and more expensive.
14731 14731 We should not allow today 's crisis to compromise our efforts to tackle the world 's inescapable challenge,.
14732 14732 This is likely to have major social and economic consequences, notably for public sector spending in vital areas such as healthcare and education,.
14736 14736 This rate cut will hopefully will give some homeowners much-needed relief however if you do have trouble paying their home loan call your bank straight away to see if they can help.
14743 14743 Today, China is a larger part of the global economy and it is more closely integrated, including with Australia, so the international spillovers could be larger than they were back in 2003. Much will depend on the success of the various efforts to control the virus so we are monitoring developments closely.
14749 14749 Overall, the changes underlying the Great Moderation appear intact, and we see the economy as structurally less recession-prone today,.
14751 14751 which directly corresponds to reduced economic activity ; if so, any economic rebound could result in a large second wave of infections.
14763 14763 I believe there are three areas where the finance ministers and central bank governors can make progress in providing more certainty about future actions during the G20 meetings in Saudi Arabia : Trade, Climate, and Inequality,.
14764 14764 I would like to extend a warm welcome to him as he joins the Fund team and I look forward to our working closely together. The IMF is putting all hands-on deck to help our membership address this crisis -- and Geoffrey will play a key role in our efforts.
14767 14767 For example, coming with the unified tax system, and the demonetisation that took place. These are steps that over time are beneficial, but of course, they might, might be somewhat disruptive over short term,.
14772 14772 my immense gratitude to @ pontifex for joining our dialogue and for your inspiring words. We fully share your vision that the global economy needs to be more inclusive, more fraternal and should care about our common home, our planet.
14773 14773 We would be a much richer world,.
14777 14777 Given the scale of the climate challenge and the rising expectations of our citizens, 2020 must be a year of climate action where everybody 's in, and that includes the world 's leading financial centre,.
14778 14778 There 's less tourism - as you can see on our streets here in the UK. That 's lower activity as well. We would expect world growth would be lower than it otherwise would be, and that has a knock-on effect on the UK.
14782 14782 would be lower than it otherwise would be and that it has a knock-on effect on the UK.
14789 14789 I think they are ( listening ), they 're listening to the realities, so these issues have moved very swiftly from being corporate responsibility issues or more niche issues within finance to become fundamental value drivers. I think we 're seeing a fundamental reshaping of the financial system,.
14790 14790 I miss the David Brinkley days and the Walter Cronkite days where you can trust that they have done their homework,.
14793 14793 Meanwhile 16 million people are entering the jobs stream each year -- most facing the prospect of poor quality jobs, or no jobs at all. All this presents an enormous challenge.
14797 14797 So we will discuss our response to the whole range of Russian missile systems -- conventional and nuclear -- currently deployed or under development.
14798 14798 At the meeting today, allies called for restraint and de-escalation. A new conflict would be in no one 's interest. So, Iran must refrain from further violence and provocations.
14805 14805 We must continue to work hard to ensure that this health crisis does not become a security crisis and that we are better prepared when the next crisis comes.
14808 14808 We should not be tempted to trade short term economic benefits for longer term challenges to our security.
14810 14810 so it 's reasonable to think the fear of job loss right now is very low.
14812 14812 If we 're right, the unemployment rate will keep falling, heading towards 3 % by the end of the year,.
14815 14815 No one can have been much surprised at the record plunges in both consumer sentiment, reported by the University of Michigan survey, and small business confidence and activity, reported by the National Federation of Independent Business,.
14823 14823 We are pleased to see that speeds have generally improved, however we need more action from NBN Co and retail service providers so that all consumers can access their full NBN plan speeds,.
14826 14826 However, we are concerned there is a risk that some of the proposed arrangements may have a long-term anti-competitive effect, especially as this authorisation covers a majority of private health insurers.
14831 14831 I would not favor that at this time,.
14833 14833 It 's probably a good idea to look at Alibaba at this stage,.
14834 14834 Although there are some opportunities to get, I would certainly claim it 's most likely an excellent suggestion to keep some powder completely dry for one more slump. We may see a dual base,.
14838 14838 There is a dark cloud hovering over, which could represent a problem,.
14844 14844 And you think he would listen ?.
14848 14848 Muji 's case teaches foreign companies that they should place securing rights in China at the center of their branding strategy,.
14851 14851 The gameplay naturally forces them to remove each other from the game, so the format has enough in it to feature drama. In ` Big Brother' or ` Survivor,' there are also game elements that can [ kick someone out ] but this is just them, in their bubble, having to turn on each other,.
14852 14852 The lockdown should be called off as soon as possible,.
14856 14856 This would avoid hot conflict in Libya,.
14862 14862 It is anticipated the Ethereum network will implement Progressive Proof of Work this year, which would effectively eliminate ASIC mining on the network thereby increasing the relative efficiency of GPU mining facilities. Additionally, GPUs provide us with flexibility to identify and focus these computing resources on other existing and new cryptocurrencies if they become more profitable to mine, or for other high efficiency computing applications.
14869 14869 On the fiscal side there was already one major reform that was done which was the corporate tax and we think that should affect though of course it takes a while, it is not something that happens immediately.
14874 14874 If you shut down everything for three months, you stop the pandemic, new cases go to zero, you have one or two quarters of really bad economic activity, and then you go back gradually to normal,.
14875 14875 It means they 're going to go without. And you do n't want to think about what going without a medical ventilator means when you 're seriously ill with COVID-19,.
14876 14876 I 've gotten a decent amount of my stickers for free, and most of them are from places or people significant to me.
14878 14878 bound by the idea that one gender should propose.
14879 14879 If you want that surprise proposal, I hope you get it. Tradition can be beautiful. But as I see it, if we want to achieve equality, we have to rethink the social norms around getting engaged,.
14881 14881 We ´ ve listened to small businesses to understand how we can best help them,.
14888 14888 I just think it is a very punk thing to do -- to put a rock and roll museum in a police station would be fantastic. Everybody would go for that.
14890 14890 Oasis fans from All Around The World could be about to get some great news with the odds of a reunion continuing to shorten.
14891 14891 I wrote a song last year called The worlds in need - / : ; ( £ ) ( might have to release it does n't matter if it 's out of tune as it 's true c 'm on you know LG x ( sic ).
14897 14897 I think it 's something we could all use this time of year, when it 's kind of cold and dreary outside. It 's a love story. It 's a story about true love, the magic of true love.
14900 14900 I would like to assure the people of Sudan that I am safe and in good shape,.
14902 14902 We would be failing the secretary-general if we did not address the issue of climate impacts ... I do not see any solution in the Sahel at the moment ... unless it encompassed what we are saying,.
14907 14907 The Federal Reserve and other central banks should defend against inflation that is too low at least as vigorously as they resist inflation that is modestly too high.
14908 14908 could limit the Fed 's ability to reduce longer term rates by QE or other measures.
14909 14909 much closer to a major snowstorm or a natural disaster than it is to a classic 1930s style depression.
14916 14916 When you hit the capacity of intensive care beds then you might get an additional shift up which could reset the rate of increase thereafter,.
14922 14922 This show takes the point of view that symbolic representations provide individuals access to an emotional and symbolic reality that allows us to better understand the experiences of the Shoah and provide it with meaning that can address our urgent present,.
14925 14925 I think the boldest storytellers are the ones who take that chance and risk. Stories about the Holocaust are some of the most important stories to tell, but I think a lot of buyers caution against it because it 's not safe or easy.
14927 14927 Our oceans are under so much pressure, seismic testing and drilling can only make things much worse,.
14930 14930 I welcome Namo 's statement in Kolkata that History, as we know, should be reviewed. He should implement that statement by re-naming Victoria Memorial as Rani Jhansi Smarak Mahal. Queen Victoria took over India after the betrayal of Rani Jhansi in 1857 and looted India for 90 years.
14939 14939 JNU can never improve until it is shut down for two years. Uneducated and unqualified people were deliberately given admission there under the Congress rule. The hostel rent is Rs 10 per month and students there are as old as 35-40 years and fail every year. Students in JNU have only one aim -- get a place to live in the campus in Delhi and travel across the country and participate in socialist programmes,.
14940 14940 Some of you may be wondering why we ca n't just dip into the endowment to support us through these difficult times. We do intend to distribute as much from the endowment as we responsibly can, but there are limitations to the endowment 's capacity,.
14944 14944 While the economy will be okay in 2020, I think the stock market will have a rougher go of it.
14950 14950 Valuations were very stretched. Anything probably would have pushed the stock market back on its heels,.
14951 14951 The timing could n't be worse. It 's eviscerating investor sentiment,.
14962 14962 To develop further and ensure further growth of GDP, we need primarily to stimulate the growth of investment ... to restore trust that has perhaps been lost between the authorities and business,.
14963 14963 If our president is on board, let 's get these people here,.
14965 14965 There are reasons to think this could be as bad as the Great Depression.
14968 14968 may well be greater than the costs.
14969 14969 No doubt, for a couple of week the fires were probably a deterrent, but I think those who have been watching throughout the Australia Open saw that Australia is open,.
14977 14977 The fear factor around the economic shock from preventative measures may push markets down further in the meantime,.
14978 14978 They probably feel like they need to be super careful to get things right,.
14983 14983 a closure is not being considered, but if they do it -- NIS 50 billion in lost gains will be the cost.
14986 14986 Some may suggest this is using a lot of firepower,.
14991 14991 But that is a very big ` if'.
14994 14994 Direct transfers to households may reach most but not all, as a number of commentators have pointed out, and the quantum of transfers seems inadequate to see a household through a month.
14995 14995 We can not be sure of the full impact of coronavirus on Indian economy at the moment.
14996 14996 When even elite universities become literal battlegrounds, accusations that the government is attempting to suppress dissent-even if by apathy rather than design-gain substantial credibility,.
14997 14997 It 's a sad story, I think most recently, it is politics,.
14998 14998 few companies and investors provided details at Davos on how they would rapidly transition away from an economy based on fossil fuels. Just a fraction of global businesses currently disclose the financial risks posed by climate change. Even fewer have set their own targets and timetables to do what the science demands : Reduce total greenhouse gas emissions by half over the next decade.
15001 15001 However, modest supply cuts would help to alleviate looming storage constraints, which under existing supply/demand conditions could reach capacity by the end of summer, if not earlier.
15002 15002 For the U.S. and Europe, the COVID-19 shock will likely straddle the first two quarters of the year,.
15004 15004 May I urge you not to make any changes in the rate structure in these perilous economic times, particularly keeping in mind the interest of the common people,.
15007 15007 This crisis has shown that international cooperation and solidarity are essential to protect global well-being and peace. COP26 next year should become a centre piece of revitalized global cooperation.
15009 15009 Through this hard work, I am very pleased to report that Gov. Walz announced supplemental budget recommendations that includes the entire overpayment amount to both Leech Lake and White Earth. Meaning, White Earth and Leech Lake would not have to repay the overpayments made to the tribes,.
15013 15013 But we might not get such a quick bounce-back because the virus will continue to disrupt public health and therefore the world economy for years to come.
15015 15015 they could outflank the world 's governments in ending poverty and pandemic disease.
15016 15016 You either keep the activities up and running or stop them,.
15018 15018 The social and economic consequences of inequality are profound and far-reaching : a growing sense of unfairness, precarity, perceived loss of identity and dignity, weakening social fabric, eroding trust in institutions, disenchantment with political processes, and an erosion of the social contract. The response by business and government must include a concerted effort to create new pathways to socioeconomic mobility, ensuring everyone has fair opportunities for success,.
15019 15019 naivety and an unwillingness to look closely because what we find might make life difficult.
15024 15024 With a possible recession looming, the euro area would normally be preparing to mobilize monetary and fiscal policies to cushion the shock. The problem is that, as previously detailed, there is no room for further monetary easing in the euro area. There does seem to be significant room for fiscal action, but the nonunified status of the euro area severely limits the actual scope for discretionary stabilization. This post assesses the margin of maneuver within the EU rules.
15027 15027 Going to cash could mean you will end up eating cat food five years from now.
15028 15028 people can go into remission, with no attacks for months or even years,.
15029 15029 There can also be no question that the sanctions have affected Iran 's ability to contain the outbreak, leading in turn to more infections, and possibly to the virus' spread beyond Iran 's borders,.
15031 15031 Capitalism does not work in an 18-month shutdown, capitalism can work in a 30-day shutdown.
15033 15033 is not likely to be materially affected by coronavirus developments.
15035 15035 Everybody pulled around so all of the other bits of the local NHS made sure that they could provide the PPE and we also had their supplies from the local FE college,.
15037 15037 condemnation or sense of regret.
15038 15038 He stepped into Libya, into Syria, he 's stepping into Iran and Iraq -- he wants to be able to be a kingmaker, even if his country is not all that powerful.
15041 15041 It 's not supposed to be just another government policy instrument to try to engineer outcomes. And what we 've seen is central banks trying too hard to do just that, and they 've engineered us right into a negative rate scenario, which completely undermines the idea of having faith in the future.
15043 15043 One thing I 've learned in life is not to let people manage your affairs who are delusional enough to think they could outbid Chevron and outsmart Buffett,.
15049 15049 I would also expect that, because Australia is so close to China that this will end up being a net negative for you.
15051 15051 For many [ small-scale farmers ], asset accumulation is like the game of snakes and ladders : a decade of additions to one 's assets can be eroded in a single storm or drought,.
15052 15052 Indy Scotland must be a republic and tax this arrogant fool.
15057 15057 Some early stage signs in surveys suggest there could be a stirring in the undergrowth when it comes to company investment plans,.
15058 15058 There is a little benefit of such inflows in the case of Pakistan, and much potential risk. As already explained, if these short-term liabilities continue to build, they can constrain monetary policy and generate external vulnerability,.
15059 15059 We are fortunate to be in a position to step up to serve our clients, ensure the financial security of our team, and at the same time rise up to serve our community. We are all working together as a family office for all of our clients and to ease the burden for our community. We hope this inspires other organizations to contribute however they can,.
15060 15060 People going from stock to bonds or stocks to cash, they 're likely causing what will be permanent damage to their portfolio ; they 're likely not going to go back to stocks until the market 's recovered,.
15065 15065 Singapore can not imagine a future burning oil and gas and think the rest will switch to low carbon,.
15066 15066 But all the adaptation in the world will not be enough if we do not mitigate,.
15068 15068 Road Safety laws remain in force and will be enforced. Drivers must not speed or drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs and they must keep their vehicles roadworthy -- for their own sakes and all our sakes.
15069 15069 a safe public transport system is something all stakeholders should aspire towards.
15072 15072 I need short bursts of power and speed to shoot up a climb, clear a gap, or pump through a rhythm session,.
15073 15073 I think people should be preparing a fiscal expansion,.
15075 15075 I do n't think we should be afraid of getting inflation,.
15077 15077 It 's something the Fed can do very quickly, and the markets understand it well.
15081 15081 Given the fast pace of change, driven by the 4th industrial revolution -- from artificial intelligence to robotics, machine learning, quantum computing -- Africa must invest more in re-directing and re-skilling its labour force, and especially the youth, to effectively participate.
15089 15089 one will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns or mistakes.
15092 15092 We cleared 60 jobs last night that involved significant damage, which is a fantastic effort. We have teams out again today dealing with the remaining jobs. I would like to thank all of the surrounding units that sent teams to assist as well.
15093 15093 we think we do have the tools that will be able to achieve.
15095 15095 At the end of the day, there are some things that are bigger than football, and I think all of us have some adapting to do during these times,.
15098 15098 I recall hearing ( BBC commentator ) Christopher Martin-Jenkins on radio saying, ` Surely someone, somewhere, could come up with something better,' and I realised that it was a mathematical problem that required a mathematical solution,.
15101 15101 Even a bad-case scenario would not warrant a permanently lower valuation for equities anywhere close to what markets are currently pricing in. Unfortunately, even the huge monetary, fiscal and regulatory policy response on the way across the western world is no obvious circuit breaker in a medical emergency. We need more clarity about the course of the pandemic first,.
15103 15103 We have look at whether the Chinese government will be able to really control and cope with this confidence problem in terms of handling the coronavirus,.
15105 15105 It 's been a little stressful with all the information coming in and not sure what to expect or how this will affect our families or coworkers and the community. I 've been taking it one day at a time. We 're well prepared now, we have a plan in place for everything and we know where to go if we have questions.
15107 15107 One of the real questions I think we face is can government incentivize mitigation rather than disincentivize it ?.
15109 15109 We need an independent state figure that 's not the government who can guarantee this data will eventually be deleted,.
15110 15110 By drawing too much attention ( to consumer price movement ), the BOJ might not be able to achieve economic and financial stability,.
15111 15111 I think the biggest factor is fear,.
15112 15112 It is a miscalculation in the immediate run. It creates a lot of investment problems. Outsiders looking at India may not know about contemporary history. They see problems with the police and in civil society, raids on university campuses.
15113 15113 The Gregorian calendar is a business inconvenience, as its quarters of unequal length cause earnings to fluctuate and stocks to be more volatile. With consistent 91-day quarters every year, my Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar would eliminate this problem,.
15117 15117 There have n't been many issues with our imports. If anything, we 've seen some slowing down on bringing in the product on our end due to port closures. We work with the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports and they are closed two to three days a week. This means that there 's been some delays on getting the product out of the containers.
15120 15120 Our health service is used to managing infections and would assure the public that we are prepared.
15123 15123 If you tax people who work and you pay people who do n't work, you will get less people working,.
15130 15130 Without fresh escalation, investors can not maintain a heightened sense of geopolitical anxiety. The recovery of U.S. shares yesterday set the tone for today 's rebound in Asia and Europe,.
15133 15133 Leeds can not rely on luck to avoid serious flood damage forever.
15134 15134 if the water had have risen in the river just a few centimeters more we would have been devastated in exactly the same way, because we still do not have the flood defences that we were promised and that we need.
15135 15135 Of course, the children of the parents lucky enough to own multiple homes will probably benefit from that so there 's a generational and a class divide.
15139 15139 Would n't it be ironic, now that we have a substantially more diverse student body, if the kids of those graduates all of a sudden did n't get the legacy advantage that the rest of the people in their dorms did when they were there,.
15141 15141 For most people, I 'd say just stay the course and focus on the long term, not the short term, because we can never predict the short term,.
15142 15142 We are excited to take this first step to commence business operations. Our management team has significant experience in the e-cigarette market. As we previously disclosed, we have been evaluating opportunities within this market because of our experience and we believe that this particular opportunity can provide tremendous value for our stockholders in the future.
15143 15143 If there is anyone to ask about working out or getting big quick [ Johnson ] is the right person to ask,.
15148 15148 It is vital that production can be undertaken in a way that respects planetary environmental boundaries,.
15152 15152 If anything, I expect the discussion about inequality to be even more robust in the aftermath of this crisis.
15156 15156 I think it would be a good thing, if nothing else, if the principal and the superintendent visited the preschool programs,.
15161 15161 a payroll tax cut makes little sense in this circumstance, because it does nothing for those who ca n't work .... Trump should shut the hell up.
15164 15164 The clean ( environmental ) dimension is the pressing issue of the day. But that would get trumped if ... you have to worry about where you get your energy from because you 've been cut off.
15165 15165 I would rather build a warehouse with a few guards.
15167 15167 There 's a risk that [ the decision ] can embolden prosecutors to pursue these cases,.
15170 15170 There is a lot of uncertainty. Even though we have this initial trade agreement, I think there will be more trade wars after the ( U.S. presidential ) election.
15172 15172 We must get rid of the cobwebs in our mind.
15173 15173 CFOs and CEOs are more aware and are n't likely to take on the risk of just ignoring it,.
15174 15174 I could have got a hat-trick. It was a dream come true against the best team in the world. Going to Anfield is what it ` s all about,.
15175 15175 I have no impulses really to think that we need to do anything with our policy stance different than what we are today.
15177 15177 Nobody will criticise it, because it is needed ... [ or ] the economy is going to be in trouble.
15185 15185 There was an expectation that they would be grim. This was on a scale that was not even conceivable until two weeks ago.
15186 15186 Where there is good internet service available, you can do free Wi-Fi,.
15187 15187 With the EIB 's contribution we can help even more private homeowner and owners' associations in making their homes or housing complexes more sustainable. Since the foundation of the NEF in 2014 the number of awarded energy-saving loans has been growing steadily ; we expect this growth to continue in the coming years.
15188 15188 stand ready to provide liquidity if it dries up on the market,.
15195 15195 That should be a temporary hit although the longer the economic lockdown lasts the greater danger there is that the future potential of the economy will be scarred by significant business failures and the difficulties the unemployed have getting back into the labour market.
15205 15205 If you 're frustrated, just take a break and come back to it. It 's just really important,.
15206 15206 As long as we do the policy right, we should get a pretty strong recovery,.
15209 15209 If the Olympics get canceled it 's a good idea for Airbnb to think seriously about putting off their IPO.
15214 15214 I regret not seeing her until now - 20 years is a long time. That must have been terrible for her.
15220 15220 It would be like stopping blood flowing through Japan 's economy,.
15223 15223 We are working to strengthen developing nations' ability to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and shorten the time to economic and social recovery. The poorest and most vulnerable countries will likely be hit the hardest, and our teams around the world remain focused on country-level and regional solutions to address the ongoing crisis,.
15225 15225 Legal rights for women are both the right thing to do and good from an economic perspective. When women can move more freely, work outside the home and manage assets, they are more likely to join the workforce and help strengthen their country 's economies,.
15228 15228 Our country was partitioned so that they ( those who left ) can live happily there ( in the neighbouring country ). We did not push them out. But having gone there, you ( illegal immigrants ) again want to come back. I am saying if you come back bring a portion of land also.
15230 15230 Demanding citizenship for Muslims is illogical. They can not be persecuted in Islamic countries. Even if they are, like the Shias in Pakistan, they go to Iran and not India. Those fearing persecution for their thoughts and ideologies, too, do n't wish to stay in India,.
15231 15231 JNU can never improve until it closes for two years. Uneducated and unqualified people were deliberately inadmitd there under the congressional government. The rent of the hostel is 10 rs per month and students are as old as 35-40 years old and fail every year. JNU students have only one goal : to get a place to live on the Delhi campus and travel around the country and participate in socialist programs,.
15247 15247 There may be a cut that we are still hoping would be in the 0.1-0.2 percentage space,.
15249 15249 If you look at the financial sectors, you have stress there, particularly with non-bank financial corporations. We have seen a tremendous weakness in the credit growth, business sentiment as there appears to be quite sharply an increase in risk aversion in lending in the markets. Alongside that, there has been weakness in rural income growth.
15251 15251 In October, we described the world economy as a synchronised slowdown with escalating downside risks that could further derail growth.
15252 15252 Such events alongside rising geopolitical risks and intensifying social unrest could reverse easy financing conditions, expose financial vulnerabilities and severely disrupt growth,.
15253 15253 To me, the market seems to be more driven by liquidity than anything about the coronavirus ... but it 's also like we saw with the U.S. confrontation with Iran,.
15254 15254 I do think that this is a relief rally and sort of the mirror image of the knee-jerk sell-off that we saw last week.
15256 15256 As chief economist you ... realize how lonely some of the [ national ] leaders are .... They can not open up with the operations division with whom they are negotiating for money, but some of them will open up with the chief economist where the interaction is more advisorial,.
15261 15261 if we do n't get the public health right.
15264 15264 seems certain to have a significant effect at least for a quarter or two.
15265 15265 ... longer-term Treasury yields have risen substantially over the past couple of months since the FOMC initiated this round of asset purchases. I believe that this increase in Treasury yields likely reflects a number of significant factors, including incoming information suggesting a somewhat stronger economic outlook and the fiscal package that was announced by President Obama in early December and approved by the Congress about two weeks later.
15274 15274 We 've invested $ 2.5 billion beginning in the last 12-13 days and we 've been buying all the way down, so we are voting with our feet if you will .... We think the President is correct, we think Mnuchin is correct, they handled this virus correctly and they shut it down and the economy will come roaring back but you have to give the business community, the investment community the confidence there is an end date.
15276 15276 I actually think that some of the mistakes we 've made and the work we 've done to try to fix those mistakes is serving us right now,.
15277 15277 What I would do if I was n't afraid is try to be the Facebook CEO and grow this business and say I 'm a feminist.
15281 15281 If there is no action, we will be in a climate emergency.
15286 15286 ( As ) the deficiencies of the international monetary and financial system have become increasingly potent. Even a passing acquaintance with monetary history suggests that this centre wo n't hold,.
15287 15287 Activity is likely to weaken materially in the coming months.
15294 15294 It is a very difficult situation and Taliban must honour their commitment. We need to see reduction in violence,.
15305 15305 We have made enormous progress, but Daesh can return.
15311 15311 Recent experience suggests the impact is quite low,.
15313 15313 This is n't financial. This is not some obtuse thing on a screen. Schools may close. I may not be able to get pasta or oatmeal.
15315 15315 Millions of job losses are likely in coming weeks, particularly for households that live paycheck to paycheck,.
15316 15316 A huge service-sector recession is coming, and we 're talking about more than 10 million jobs at risk that are often low-wage, low-benefit, or tip-based.
15321 15321 You should spend as much as you can in a targeted way on things like unemployment insurance, nutritional assistance, paid leave, and help for states,.
15324 15324 We looking at something pretty serious here -- probably 10-15 % unemployment.
15328 15328 Because they have a very different culture and they have developed so quickly there is a natural unease. That is where we think we can play a big role in building that bridge through football. China can get an understanding of what we are about and Australians can get a better understanding of what they are about.
15330 15330 judged by the steep descent in the dollar 's value as measured against other currencies in the ensuing months, there can be no denying that the plan worked.
15331 15331 I would bring my own perspective, but I think the intellectual diversity strengthens the discussion and would be welcomed, so that 's what I would hope to bring,.
15337 15337 Especially now we are looking for ways in which we can remain connected to our faith and our community. Many of our parishioners have prayed together while apart, in their homes at the same time, and some of our prayer groups are planning the same strategy,.
15343 15343 Some pharmacies have increased prices to between 70 and 100 rubles ( US $ 1.10 to US $ 1.60 ) whereas a mask would sell for 1.5 rubles before the New Year,.
15347 15347 We know that consumers are frustrated with the cost of parking at the airport, but there are steps people can take to help secure more favourable rates,.
15354 15354 While a sustained bear market does not look likely, a near-term correction is looking much more probable.
15359 15359 If you 're a supply chain professional, this is called the bullwhip effect,.
15375 15375 we should see the growth returning.
15382 15382 It is expensive for him to be in Blantyre. If government officials want to see him, they have to go to Blantyre which is expensive,.
15383 15383 It 's amazing how quickly you can move if you 're working with the right people.
15387 15387 Responsible employers can apply these workforce principles and guidelines to better balance short-term crisis measures against the medium - and long-term objectives.
15390 15390 At worst, gross hiring might have dipped a bit, though the strong recent payroll numbers cast doubt even on that idea. Layoffs remain at their lowest, as a share of the workforce, since the data were first collected on their current basis in 1948.
15393 15393 funneled a fortune into the storied crabber, hoping the new and improved Cornelia will help them beat the Russian and American competition to the dock. This season, they plan to work their crew even harder, including a new crew member who proves to be their secret weapon : Maria, a 25-year-old Alaskan native who has spent most of her life working on boats. She certainly shows the guys more than a thing or two.
15395 15395 Accordingly, the number of intense hydrometeorological disasters could increase by 5.4 percent annually for an ` average' country facing nearly one extreme disaster annually,.
15403 15403 If the government delivers on its promises to make the new system quicker, more efficient, less bureaucratic and more user-friendly, it could be good news for employers and the wider economy,.
15404 15404 Sustaining these gains requires further deepening of policy and institutional reforms. Competition policy is a key tool that can be used to contribute to sustained and pro-poor economic growth,.
15407 15407 There is a protocol to follow but let us not forget it is the people who voted for them and they are supposed to be serving them,.
15408 15408 Unless a vaccine is discovered quickly, it is unlikely that there will be any riskless or painless course of action,.
15410 15410 We ca n't believe that things like the weather will take care of it. If that was the case, the virus would n't have spread to tropical places like Singapore and Philippines,.
15413 15413 may amplify the adverse impact of shocks to the global economy.
15419 15419 you may not be helping them by offering more loans.
15422 15422 The resident 's aides and defenders have claimed that it is ` normal' or ` usual' to use U.S. foreign assistance as the president did to achieve a desired outcome. How was the president 's act in withholding U.S. security assistance to Ukraine different from how the U.S. uses foreign assistance to achieve foreign policy goals and national security objectives ?,.
15423 15423 The SAFE vehicles rule, if finalized in its present form, will lead to vehicles that are neither safer, nor more affordable or fuel efficient,.
15426 15426 The way in which countries help or do not help each other can shape perceptions of European integration for a long time to come,.
15427 15427 The whole point of a democracy is that people need to have confidence in it, so even if things look a bit dodgy that 's enough to warrant another look.
15432 15432 We can transfer passengers on each other. We are the only Middle Eastern carrier going into their hub so there is huge opportunity,.
15434 15434 the German economy seems unaffected by developments surrounding the coronavirus. The survey results and other indicators suggest economic growth in the first quarter will amount to 0.2 percent.
15436 15436 People want to have a sense that there is a limit to the spread of this virus perhaps because of containment measures or because there is hope that some kind of viral solution can be found,.
15438 15438 The government should also require each of its agencies and public sector units, including at the state level, to pay their bills immediately, so that private firms get valuable liquidity,.
15439 15439 The number given by the World Bank and IMF in terms of the changes are way too optimistic because even if we lose one month 's output, we are talking about pretty negative rate of growth and that is what should determine how we respond,.
15440 15440 The government must use its strong mandate to deliver expeditiously on reforms, which will enable the economy to strongly rebound in 2020-21.
15442 15442 So the number we came up with Rs 10 lakh crore ( Centre and states combined ) or 5 per cent of the GDP,.
15445 15445 If There Is No Unity ....
15446 15446 If those countries can use the East Asian approach to contain the epidemic, they will come out without disaster,.
15447 15447 Nobody was able to do anything, except to say they could n't do anything.
15448 15448 If you are sick, do n't travel. If you have flu-like symptoms, wear a mask and see a doctor. And when you travel wash your hands frequently and do n't touch your face. Observing these simple measures should keep flying safe for all,.
15450 15450 Sport wo n't be available to provide people with a diversion ; if a section of the community can get a bit of enjoyment from watching the races, I would say that 's not indulgent. People do need some other things to focus on other than just the terrible burden of COVID-19.
15452 15452 Really anything that would be asked about the show, I wanted to have an answer for, or any fear that a buyer would have I wanted to be able to address,.
15453 15453 did not want to misrepresent a real person or borrow from a specific moment in an actual person 's life.
15458 15458 This means financing at better terms and longer duration, which can help pay off more expensive debts and create a more sustainable debt management process,.
15461 15461 Almost half of the victims suffered from at least three prior illnesses, and about a fourth had either one or two previous conditions. More than 75 per cent had high blood pressure, about 35 per cent had diabetes and a third suffered from heart disease.
15462 15462 Congress should compel Trump to waive the cap and compel him to get the supplies we need,.
15463 15463 That 's something you could probably do very, very quickly. With digital infrastructure, you 're basically filling in. You have rural areas that do n't have internet access, but I think the biggest part would be ensuring, say, everyone in Philadelphia, New York and Chicago has great internet service at an affordable price. It 's not a question of drawing up blueprints and going over environmental regulations.
15465 15465 If you do that, you will be building a more secure and stable society and a large number of youths will not be roaming around seeking alternatives to employment, such as risky migration, drug addiction and crimes,.
15469 15469 We expect, even with the cuts coming from OPEC +, we think at least the first half of this year, we will see a surplus of 1 million barrels per day,.
15470 15470 Playing Russian roulette in oil markets may have grave consequences,.
15474 15474 If there is enough volume to be imported and if they are looking at the geographical advantage of India, with lots of demand centres and production centres with enough volumes, [ then the country ] should be a good candidate for becoming a gas hub. But it should n't be if the volumes are not significant.
15478 15478 I also like the obelisk that seems to make an ironic gesture to the great tradition of vain brazen images, like the Ozymandias immortalised by the poet Shelley.
15481 15481 If inflation were to fall short of target for an extended period, faith in the inflation target anchor would be eroded.
15483 15483 Though the High Court noted that the issue might be better resolved in Congress than in court, the decision must echo a warning to all policymakers that to alter the current order where marriage is just between man and woman is not only legally troublesome but absolutely unnecessary and just a waste of time. The confusion, disorder and disarray that might be created by altering the man-woman order on marriage will far outweigh any iota of advancement, if there 's any, promised by those wishing to change it,.
15487 15487 So what we are doing now is to put much more emphasis on this, creating platforms where a business can co-operate with governments and civil society.
15488 15488 especially the question of whether projects would have gone ahead without this private funding,.
15489 15489 Force planners on the Central Military Commission are faced with this question : Can China recruit the talent needed to develop a PLA that is both big in size and high in quality ? The range of possible answers to that question is likely to shrink as China 's demographics begin nibbling away at the PLA 's capability.
15491 15491 Monetary policy can ease financial conditions and improve the resilience of households and firms to the short-term economic implications of Covid-19,.
15492 15492 While the Committee would like to see inflation expectations anchored closer to the mid-point of the inflation target range on a sustained basis, the lower inflation forecast and improved risk profile opens some space to provide further policy accommodation to the,.
15493 15493 must be a republic and tax this arrogant fool.
15497 15497 As a researcher, I believe I have an obligation to put out data when the data point strongly to a conclusion that can have enormous -- potentially disastrous -- public consequences if ignored,.
15499 15499 All in all, economic growth this year could come in slightly lower than our experts estimated in December,.
15502 15502 Ours is probably the most important house currently for sale on Carbon Beach,.
15507 15507 I can not imagine, however, why the court would approve the death sentence on this sorry record,.
15513 15513 You do n't have enough money to buy stuff and the government makes a transfer to you, that 's great-but not if you 're hiding under the bed.
15514 15514 How can global growth not take a long-term hit ?.
15516 15516 A sharp slowdown is likely ; whether it will be persistent enough to rise to the level of a recession is not clear yet,.
15520 15520 Some are exaggerations that are taken out of proportion, and I think that impact of some of the publicity of the last 18 months might have led some people quite innocently to revise their opinions and say, ` Oh well something happened to me' and it gets presented in a totally different way. Then people get in a sausage machine and ca n't get out of it, even if they want to.
15523 15523 He was the most powerful man in the country and I did n't know what would happen if I said ` No' or ` Get off'.
15527 15527 Africa can not afford not to achieve the Global and Regional Goals because it is the region that would suffer most from such a failure -- food insecurity, extreme poverty, and lack of access to clean and modern sources of energy would persist. This would undermine prospects for job creation for millions of youth joining the job market,.
15528 15528 It 's a little bit like, when you discover sex can be dangerous, you do n't come out and say, there should be no more sex,.
15529 15529 Our pupils and staff are all huge coffee and hot drink fans, so we thought why not create something in the school for everyone to enjoy.
15530 15530 It often goes unnoticed when governments and public servants roll up their sleeves and tackle red tape, but this hard work has such a big impact that we think it 's important to recognize it,.
15533 15533 We 've already have unprecedented levels of deaths of despair, and, if we lose a generation as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, that 's going to have mortality consequences,.
15535 15535 Companies are trying to be cautious by locking in money while they can get it. And I understand that. We are in an environment where there are a lot of uncertainties.
15536 15536 have the aptitude to make productive use of educational resources, that are usually much in excess of what they and their families could pay for.
15539 15539 Since the 1980s, governments have been told to take a back seat and let business steer and create wealth, intervening only for the purpose of fixing problems when they arise. The result is that governments are not always properly prepared and equipped to deal with crises such as Covid-19 or the climate emergency. By assuming that governments have to wait until the occurrence of a huge systemic shock before they resolve to take action, insufficient preparations are made along the way.
15541 15541 We ca n't stop this recession, but we can buffer as much as possible and what we really gain is on the other side of the recession -- the recovery,.
15550 15550 I wish for humanity to survive this deceptively friendly coronavirus. I expect China to tell all -- the raw truth -- so every nations' scientists and doctors, not just our hero Dr Anthony Fauci can use ` open source' data and find a vaccine as soon as possible,.
15551 15551 If the economic quarantine is extended for over six months, then there will job cuts that feed more job cuts.
15554 15554 If they do n't have the bracelet, they ca n't go to a restaurant or to work,.
15558 15558 If a ... single currency is used, there would be a common inflation rate and similar interest rate, a considerable growth in trade, productivity and finance integration, all of which would generate a considerable increase in economic growth and well-being.
15559 15559 In seafood and fish, everything is private. So to actually look at indicators and anticipate any collusion or any criminal behaviour is very difficult to do,.
15560 15560 It 's about the quality. I think of it that way,.
15561 15561 Salmon is probably the most popular species in retail, so that could be problematic for the industry as a whole,.
15566 15566 They are well known to most of us and I can tell you that the challenges are enormous.
15567 15567 We probably have to take some chances with some of the young guys, but absolutely,.
15570 15570 I can remember the quaint days when I was being yelled at because we had a $ 400 billion deficit and I was the CBO director. It does n't look so bad right now,.
15572 15572 I do think we could spend a lot more time thinking more broadly about this and talking to futurists and so on.
15576 15576 should not fall into the trap of new economic development strategies. Such strategies are often anti-labour and against the interests of the common people.
15578 15578 You have to think about rethinking competitive markets, and you have to think about how you 're gon na tax at the top.
15580 15580 So while we have a funding shortfall in our courts budget, which must come from taxpayers, we will be able to do more in some other areas of policing without impacting property taxpayers,.
15586 15586 The new T-Mobile would today have a market cap of $ 120 billion,.
15587 15587 He might be leaving the tough decisions to the governors so he can take credit for everything.
15591 15591 I wo n't take part in it because I do n't want to neglect my flowers. If I do n't come, they dry up and die,.
15592 15592 If Italy goes bankrupt, the economic shock in the rest of Europe will be several factors larger.
15593 15593 If you were to project that number globally, given we have 150,000 confirmed cases, we are approaching close to one million infections,.
15600 15600 Datteln-4 should not go online at all,.
15601 15601 how long does it take a hotel in Tramore or a manufacturing company in Limerick to recover to where they were in February ; to transition from the series of income and wage supports the State is providing ?.
15602 15602 I remember thinking what an amazing and fascinating thing it is to think about the impact of competition,.
15606 15606 In this crisis, humanity shares a single fate, and to achieve victory, the world must come together to affirm global co-operation, and prevent an ` outbreak' of blind xenophobia.
15607 15607 Such a significant increase in federal borrowing would also elevate the risk of a fiscal crisis,.
15612 15612 This could induce another financial ` wave' that we need to prepare for by maintaining relative macroeconomic stability.
15613 15613 This is truly cataclysmic. If companies ca n't refinance their debts they trade insolvent and it 's all over red rover,.
15618 15618 Privacy was the price one must pay for the abundant rewards of information, connection and other digital goods when, where, and how you want them,.
15623 15623 What they can do is to make sure companies do n't get starved of liquidity and needlessly go out of business rather than tying themselves over this horrible, but short-lived, situation.
15624 15624 I do n't think we should blame RBI or finance ministry for Yes Bank crisis. For Yes Bank crisis, Yes Bank is responsible,.
15626 15626 Such listings also enable companies to diversify their capital-raising activities rather than being reliant only on their domestic market. In addition, Indian start-up or emerging-growth companies, for example, will be able to access capital from investors overseas that may be more receptive to their securities than Indian investors, who have typically focused on companies with proven track records of profitability and growth, and have generally exhibited less appetite for start-up or emerging-growth companies,.
15628 15628 When we were able to arrange these N95 masks -- over a million of them -- I thought it would be great if we could do something to actually complement Governor Cuomo 's great leadership in the state,.
15629 15629 You think about the people who live day to day ... you got to get the economy going again.
15630 15630 And of course in China, with a command economy, they can really put resources behind the cure and the solution. So I do n't think it will be as long as people expect.
15632 15632 most of the 5G-related activities could be delayed until the pandemic situation improves,.
15634 15634 We 're going to need to be thinking about the immediate term, the medium term, and the longer run.
15635 15635 With the sanctions, we can say that the government has lost at least 30 percent of its budget revenues. This has inevitably had an impact on their health system,.
15638 15638 The government continues to monitor and take more steps as estimates show that the cases may peak in April and May.
15640 15640 Can I just take shelter here for a moment ?.
15641 15641 People who switch organizations -- whether they 're wide receivers changing football teams or general managers going to new companies -- all face similar problems. It 's not just about the learning curve. Moves of all kinds entail significant internal and external challenges and transaction costs : upheaval in your home and social life ; potential relocation expenses ; adjustments to new cultural and political norms ; navigation of unclear expectations ; and the need to learn a new canon, skill set, and jargon.
15642 15642 Trade policy is becoming just another political tool for many different policy ends, such as economic diplomacy, geopolitical influence or environmental policy,.
15644 15644 In some spots the fire was pretty hot and that could spall off the layers of limestone on the surface, especially if trees fell over and burnt after the fire front,.
15646 15646 we need to flatten both the virus curve and the recession curve. So this would be a good start. But if the virus persists we may need far more stimulus.
15647 15647 Among the biggest contributors to the rally, as I see it, is the hope that 2020 could finally see institutional investors move into the digital field en masse, prompted by growing client demand and more attractive ways to get exposure than direct ownership of coins,.
15650 15650 If people do not get sick as often, then business will benefit with lower health insurance premiums,.
15653 15653 Now is the time to keep people home and think of ways to help them pay the bills. The solution will have to come from the state, and it is going to cost a lot,.
15655 15655 To bridge the gap by attracting investments in the sector, the country must introduce bond, blended and remittance financing.
15656 15656 We are concerned consumers may have purchased tickets believing many of these advertised high profile players would be playing when, in the end, this was not the case,.
15657 15657 Anything that further entrenches Bunnings' position, or attempts to remove current or potential future competitive threats to Bunnings, will be very closely scrutinised,.
15661 15661 That may prompt consumers to ring up the hotel they 're thinking of going to,.
15669 15669 But it is clear we alone can not achieve the change we seek.
15671 15671 Our ecological footprint has expanded far beyond what the Earth can sustain. Our social systems are cracking. Our economies no longer drive inclusive growth,.
15680 15680 African countries have an infrastructure gap of between 68 billion dollars to 108 billion, which could be adequately addressed by utilising the 1.8 trillion dollars accrued pension and sovereign wealth funds.
15682 15682 That way, we will avoid moral hazards, and ratings agencies will be less inclined to penalise any institution on the potential risk to their preferred creditor status. The focus of the world should now be on helping everyone, as a risk to one is a risk to all,.
15683 15683 If inflation remains below or close to target, it may be appropriate to adopt a lower target over the medium term, provided that this change is carefully implemented and communicated. Coordination with fiscal policy would also be key, including to ensure that a lower target and related tightening of money supply would not crowd out private-sector credit.
15693 15693 The state must explore potential options for in-person voting opportunities for a limited number of our citizens to ensure that we are demonstrating that democracy can still flourish in the midst of a public health emergency,.
15694 15694 In the Senate, we are working to video stream floor sessions and voting sessions, which we would not have normally done,.
15697 15697 should be raised or at least maintained when slowing demand from the masses is a leading cause behind the economic slowdown,.
15703 15703 If you accept the proposition the effects are profound, then it 's going to affect asset values,.
15706 15706 Australians should feel proud of our banknotes. They are innovative and contain world-leading security features that keep the banknotes secure,.
15709 15709 Climate change is affecting the nature of production in Australia, the nature of investment, ultimately the nature of our exports, at the moment I think it 's affecting confidence in people and therefore ultimately spending,.
15715 15715 We are a large, established business. We have the ability to help, and now we are both really focused on keeping our services up and running, but also doing as much good as we can do.
15716 15716 The case for greater fiscal powers includes the use of tax changes ( cuts ) to promote certain economic sectors and the possibility that linking decisions about spending to ones about taxing would improve accountability and the quality of decision-making,.
15720 15720 It 's hard to overstate the geopolitical importance of Friday 's assassination of Qassim Soleimani, architect of Iran 's external military activity for more than 20 years and perhaps the most powerful man in the country after the Supreme Leader,.
15723 15723 Pre-virus, the labor market was strong, if weather-assisted. Now, trouble is coming, fast.
15730 15730 These are the bargains of a lifetime if we manage this crisis correctly,.
15731 15731 If they handle this virus correctly and they shut it down, the economy will come roaring back,.
15732 15732 These hedges will likely mitigate portfolio losses in severe market declines, while also somewhat reduce the portfolio 's upside potential if there is minimal economic or market impact from the virus,.
15733 15733 I do n't think I 'm alone among central bankers who like the idea that much,.
15736 15736 appears to be outpacing our ability to build new homes, which can put renewed pressure on prices.
15740 15740 No matter how you look at GDP, we can see the shrinking.
15741 15741 One thing we 've learned in the crisis in 2008 is that policy is a lot more than the sum of its parts if it 's done as a global response,.
15744 15744 Shutting down one of those plants would compromise the food security of many Canadians,.
15746 15746 Before, consumers went [ grocery shopping ] to buy a finished food product for that day or the next couple of days,.
15748 15748 You can not protect the knowledge of a recipe.
15753 15753 There can be consequences like decreased maternal health and higher mortality, infant mortality, lower baby weights and anemia among mothers as all of this will be unchecked during antenatal checkups,.
15761 15761 Contrary to what people think, the hands are the way that these viruses most efficiently spread. Top of the list is frequent hand washing, hand sanitising, or both,.
15762 15762 Avoid touching your face. If you cough or sneeze, it 's important to cover your face with a sleeve. Better yet, a tissue to be disposed of carefully, and then sanitizing the hands afterward. Washing your hands and drying them is the best procedure. When that 's not easy to do, alcohol-based sanitizer is a good second-best.
15763 15763 I have doubts on whether the 9 per cent interest rate will be effective given the perspective of the market economy,.
15764 15764 I teach high school, so if there is not a hum in the background, I 'm confused,.
15766 15766 If we hunt these monsters, do we risk becoming them ourselves ?.
15767 15767 That was the responsibility that weighed on me every night and every morning for years, while writing, producing, editing this show. It is the thing I go to sleep thinking about and the thing I wake up working to honor.
15769 15769 You think you 're a great writer until you meet a great actor,.
15772 15772 We believe accuracy should be preserved when you talk about the real historical place. ` Fictional' is a bad excuse. Respect accuracy and the memory of the victims.
15775 15775 The consequences of letting the disease spread further would be devastating. And Pakistan 's initial coronavirus response is already exposing concerning political patterns -- including the powerful army asserting competence over the civilian government -- that will persist beyond the pandemic,.
15776 15776 Putting up public money to support an industry that serves the rich would be hard to justify. It 's absurd.
15779 15779 that 's actually the best-case scenario if we have an outbreak like that.
15793 15793 In short : the situation is evolving rapidly, and we should stand ready to provide a more forceful, coordinated response if conditions require it. Along these lines, I welcome the statement from the G7 yesterday ( Tuesday ) that they are ready to cooperate further on timely and effective measures.
15794 15794 We 're on about people going all over the place, but no one seems to be going on about it apart from me.
15797 15797 But all this means is that we have comparable population sizes and had a comparable number of deaths in week 12 as Italy had in week 10. We may be on a less steep trajectory than Italy, but it 's too early to know yet.
15799 15799 until I see either financial stability issues looming or some indication that inflation is going to pick up strongly. I do n't see that now and it is not in my forecast.
15802 15802 It is likely to be overturned by the courts and subject automakers to years of costly litigation and confusion in the process.
15803 15803 utterly fails to provide any demonstrable safety, environmental or economic benefit to consumers or the country,.
15804 15804 While this is a less dramatic rollback than the 0 % annual stringency increase that was included in the proposed rule, it still falls well short of the historic average 2.4 % per year actual tailpipe-efficiency standard increases that the fleet has achieved without the use of any credits or other compliance flexibilities,.
15813 15813 this must be balanced against the concerns raised by other stakeholders who described the negative impacts of criminal activity and tax evasion.
15816 15816 We think this will be the most effective way to have country programs be successful and regional programs be successful.
15820 15820 If he thinks I 'm joining the High Flying Birds but calling it Oasis, he 's got another thing coming.
15825 15825 I just do n't think I 'll be able to work with myself any longer, I can write what I like and so can he but I think it 's for the best.
15826 15826 We were alright, we were better than a lot of shit out there but we were n't pushing the boundaries, we were n't Pink Floyd or The Beatles,.
15827 15827 Listen seriously a lot of people think I 'm a cunt and I am a good looking cunt but once this is put to bed we need to get Oasis back for a 1 of ( f ) gig rite for charity. C ’ mon Noel we can then go back to our amazing solo careers c 'm on you know LG x,.
15831 15831 Azar could n't get through to Trump to speak with him about the virus until Jan. 18. When he reached Trump by phone, the president interjected to ask about vaping and when flavored vaping products would be back on the market.
15832 15832 can have debilitating lifelong effects.
15833 15833 shaped much more by the coronavirus epidemic than by economic fundamentals or shifts in monetary or fiscal policy.
15835 15835 If they insist on their positions we are going to march in protest against them.
15845 15845 We took the average of the low point of happiness and we got 47.2 and that seemed like a pretty good statistic. I think onwards in my life I 'm going to be known as Mr 47.2, but there 's worse things to be called.
15848 15848 Like all of you, I have been intently following reports of Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) and considering the many ways in which its future course might alter my life and the lives of those closest to me. These past few weeks have been a powerful reminder of just how connected we are to one another -- and how our choices today determine our options tomorrow,.
15858 15858 would be tantamount to stripping off some of the most fundamental and stabilising elements of Tongan society.
15861 15861 heading into or out of recession, or where we are in the business cycle.
15862 15862 I think we have more important matters to be tackling than micro-managing our gateway signs,.
15867 15867 That would be completely fine to do.
15868 15868 We can open our eyes and look at what 's going on around us.
15869 15869 I do n't know that that would be consistent for the electorate as a whole.
15873 15873 That would have a huge impact on confidence. These are the people who will be hurt most by the virus. They are scared,.
15876 15876 Maybe, he should take it offline,.
15877 15877 These online applications have an enormous attack surface and while we can mitigate some of that attack surface,.
15878 15878 This nonsignificantly lower rate of readmissions is the substantive finding of our trial, but for me, the most important finding is the second one -- that if you just do a pre - and postintervention study, it provides a very misleading picture that suggests the intervention is working,.
15880 15880 We will formulate a safeguard, so that policymakers that are taking measures to improve public health and the economy can not be criminalized because of the acts of others.
15883 15883 At this point, the analysis has not been done to answer those questions, whether it 's racial bias or there are other circumstances,.
15886 15886 It means that if 100,000 businesses would have gone out of business before, now maybe only 25,000 will. That 's actually probably a reasonable outcome given how horrendous the current circumstances are,.
15887 15887 Marketing was originally thought of as communications, but successful brands are those that find an open hole in the mind in a specific category and then become the first to fill the hole with their brand name.
15888 15888 then it 's not clear that monetary policy would have sufficient space.
15890 15890 climate disclosure must become comprehensive.
15897 15897 In that quarter, April may have been the worst month. It may go down as ` Black April' in the history of the oil industry.
15899 15899 I expect the Treasury 10-year yield to fall to zero, perhaps within two years,.
15905 15905 Broadly speaking there are three big challenges -- relief is slow coming for bills due now, people are falling through government eligibility cracks, and too much of the relief is in the form of deferrals and loans, which just adds to the fear of coming out of this crisis with a mountain of debt that will be difficult or impossible to repay,.
15909 15909 If there 's no unity, we still have to move on. Whatever is necessary must be done,.
15911 15911 I think the CAA must be scrapped because it can not be an Act ... That 's the job of the Supreme Court to see whether what was passed in Parliament can be legally attached to the Constitution,.
15912 15912 RBA should stop pretending there 's any more it can usefully do.
15914 15914 The decision for Northern Ireland would very much have been made by people here who know how our health service works, know what our infrastructure is like and [ are ] very much across the detail of what will work when the time comes to move into those phases of closing and restricting access.
15926 15926 I think it 's a long shot at this point,.
15931 15931 Science has moved on. Research keeps moving. Clinical documentation is important. My ears are open, my mind is open. I have a skeptical approach, I am not an atheist. I should point out that there are hypocrites. They sing paeans of the Indian medicine, but turn to the Western medicine, when needed,.
15940 15940 I think I can not make any value addition to the ECC,.
15943 15943 The agenda of securing the peace and the agenda of silencing the guns must be dealt with in a comprehensive manner.
15949 15949 But I think that definitely I have missed out on the social aspects of renting and living in town.
15951 15951 on people 's conception of what a trade policy should be,.
15953 15953 For instance, I can not say that I 'm a Brahmin and since there 's equality before the law, I must also get reservation. You can not seek equality among unequals,.
15955 15955 We have n't said anything against Muslims. We have only said those who have been persecuted for religious reasons, who had been hanging in this country for decades without citizenship, those who have not got cards and jobs .... This state of affairs must end.
15956 15956 It seems like people in sectors involved with furloughing or even in less secure positions are going to be in serious trouble.
15957 15957 The markets tend to exaggerate non-economic variables, and what I think the markets have decided is that Asia is going to be hit hardest because of its ties with China.
15960 15960 You can understand why people do n't want to go to movies, restaurants, shopping malls,.
15961 15961 We wo n't know that. It takes months to get the data that would be relevant to a call like that. But it would n't be a bit surprising to me.
15966 15966 All foreigners located in Russia and diagnosed with a new type of coronavirus will undergo treatment until they are fully cured. After that, they will decide whether to stay on the territory of our country or not,.
15968 15968 The question I would ask of our leaders is : What will you regret ?.
15970 15970 While all taxes impede economic growth to one extent or another, the capital gains tax is at the far end of the scale.
15975 15975 probably have to take some chances with some of the young guys.
15976 15976 I think they can work through the adversity. Whether we want to say it or not, this team expects to be in the playoffs. This team does expect excellence. You 've got Andre ( Drummond ) and Blake ( Griffin ) out there -- these are major, major players and it does expect excellence.
15978 15978 I mean, if we hand out too many ventilators, people might prefer it to breathing on their own,.
15979 15979 The European Parliament 's call must not simply be ignored by the banking supervisory authority. Should Farkas take up his new post at AFME, Parliament will not grant him a lobby badge. We MEPs should not have meetings with the lobbyist Farkas.
15980 15980 To change the policy from here would take events like a weakening of consumer patterns, or changes in business hiring and investment plans,.
15981 15981 A company such as TIM, which competes on the market, can not wait too long,.
15983 15983 These people show through their actions that they think truth, freedom, and justice are not merely lofty words, but ideals worth sacrificing for. It is they who are fighting today for India that Mahatma Gandhi gave his life for.
15984 15984 Lower interest rates ... might make you more likely to buy a car or a house. But they do n't make you more likely to go out and expose yourself to the virus,.
15986 15986 If you want to get a loan, the interest rate you pay on the loan is influenced by what the Fed is up to,.
15989 15989 Without it, we would have been in tatters completely,.
15990 15990 which could derail progress toward fiscal consolidation.
15993 15993 It 's the natural consequence of rushing to do something that you think is helpful but not actually spending the time to figure out what devils are in the details,.
15995 15995 lead market participants to infer weakness.
15996 15996 If monetary policy is to remain relevant, policy makers will have to adopt new tools, tactics and frameworks.
16002 16002 We think about demand shocks and supply shocks : In a demand shock, yes, monetary and fiscal policy ( can be used ) but with supply shocks, it 's micro ( economics ). The trouble is with this one is that it 's both, and I think policymakers are still trying to figure out and the result will be a lot of volatility in the markets because people do n't know what they 're dong,.
16003 16003 When you start talking about safe haven, it becomes really difficult to think are these really safe-haven assets because it 's just not obvious.
16004 16004 we would have more beds and more supply in order to help critically ill patients,.
16009 16009 European countries have faced the same kind of technological change we have, and they 're not seeing the people killing themselves with guns or drug or alcohol,.
16012 16012 I think it 's a good time to examine our spending more generally,.
16013 16013 At the same time, the dramatic fall in interest rates may induce some potential buyers to take advantage of the better affordability conditions,.
16016 16016 Materials cost money that companies locked in competition would rather not spend,.
16021 16021 We held out on this decision as long as possible, in hopes that the outlook for late spring might brighten and we 'd be able to gather as usual.
16026 16026 The US can go to its key allies, and those countries together do have veto power.
16027 16027 There is a person who has an opportunity to promote themselves to potentially win the game, but it would mean turning on somebody who they had a very strong friendship and bond with. At first they sort of break this person down, but then they have a change of heart and realize they ca n't do that. I kind of think in the United Kingdom the outcome of that would have been different -- that the person would have been stabbed in the back,.
16028 16028 But just like the show 's fans, we go on a journey of discovery and love ! By the end, I would have been happy if any of the final gang won -- they had all earned it.
16038 16038 I think we 're unlikely to see a really large outbreak in the U.S. -- meaning thousands of deaths,.
16039 16039 In the last 12 to 13 years, a lot of new people entered the work force and none of them have seen something like this. I do think IT is a little insulated.
16043 16043 We are in the middle of a pandemic now, and we face an even more uncertain future, and here is when knowledge of risk can be particularly important.
16049 16049 We have a deal where you can get either a 1000 units of insulin or 1500 units of insulin for $ 25,.
16054 16054 I am writing to you directly to assure you that Edelweiss has no relationship with Capstone Forex Pvt ltd and all allegations of FEMA violations are false. Needless to say, if in the future any assistance or support to the investigation is requested from us, we will cooperate fully.
16055 16055 The right mix of truth, falsehood and silence looks very difficult to achieve -- even the Soviet Union, which chooses its preferred ` mix' more freely than most other states, seems to have mixed itself a poisonous brew.
16061 16061 We ca n't say what would have happened if the Dutch had never showed up in Indonesia,.
16068 16068 If we see a recovery, God willing, in months, people will want to turn off the taps.
16071 16071 We 've got about nine or 10 full-timers and 12 or 13 with the interns,.
16074 16074 To be sure, interest rates remain low today, suggesting that there is time to address our fiscal challenges and that fiscal policy could be used as a tool to address other challenges facing the nation, if the Congress chose to do so,.
16086 16086 However, it is clear that the decrease in employment and hours and the increase in unemployment can be ascribed to the effects of the illness and efforts to contain the virus.
16087 16087 I think it 's fair to say that more Sanders backers -- sort of like Elizabeth Warren backers -- they 're academics, they 're fairly well-to-do white people, they 're professionals, [ and ] they 're hipsters.
16089 16089 People thought I was ignoring them or being rude but I simply did n't know they were speaking to me because I ca n't see their mouth,.
16094 16094 Everyone talks about the E.U. as if it is a bastion of free trade, but it 's not. We want to trade freely with everybody, especially the United States.
16099 16099 I shall remain grateful if my colleagues can send their contributions to the fund y filling an enclosed format to be mailed to the university office within April 14 and the donated amount will be recovered from the salary of April 2020.
16100 16100 If you are trying to get to 3per cent in an economy in its 11th year of recovery that 's a tough task,.
16116 16116 Our forces are ready and Nato is working. And if needed, we are able to react,.
16118 16118 welcome any steps that can lead to reduction in violence.
16120 16120 must act to protect civilians and impose.
16123 16123 I was in Kabul a couple of weeks ago when the [ peace ] deal was signed, and to make sure that that deal is implemented, we need a united Afghan government that can be a part of a negotiated political process.
16125 16125 will be the ones that have higher numbers of hospitalizations, higher numbers of deaths and where many of the resources should be concentrated,.
16126 16126 And if the respiratory system is already inflamed because of pollution it 's like you 're putting gasoline on the fire.
16128 16128 One of the things we learned the hard way is we should n't make judgments on truth,.
16134 16134 If you ca n't talk to your boyfriend about marriage, you 're either dating the wrong person or you 're not giving him credit for being the right person,.
16136 16136 You need to ensure your governance processes empower staff to proactively engage with their own senior managers and prioritise doing the right thing even if that might have some negative financial effects,.
16138 16138 no opportunity to comment or to offer alternatives.
16140 16140 but they want to give their allies an alternative to the dollar and create a system that could n't be disrupted by the U.S.
16148 16148 I do n't think we get much more than that. I do n't see anything driving growth higher than that.
16149 16149 Expansions do n't last forever, and this one probably is getting a little long-toothed, but it 's not on life support,.
16151 16151 If the market keeps going down 1,000 points a day, that will spook people very fast,.
16152 16152 Our staff are currently working on identifying vulnerable countries and estimating potential financing needs should the situation deteriorate further,.
16161 16161 I stress there is tremendous uncertainty about the outlook : it could get worse depending on many variable factors, including the duration of the pandemic,.
16162 16162 Of course one should not say ` hop' until one jumped, but things are looking very good,.
16172 16172 Be ready to act if growth slows again. That means having your portfolio of projects prepared.
16181 16181 I think a ` V' is possible,.
16183 16183 Except for maybe a few hardcore people in the Grand Final, no one in the United States, if they do n't Google the result, will possibly remember who won the Collingwood-Essendon match from last year, and we can watch it and learn,.
16185 16185 Why he would want to come to join us.
16188 16188 I hear he 's going to be a free agent but we 're not allowed to talk to him until March. I do n't know why he would want to come to Miami as we are a rebuilding team,.
16190 16190 When you cough or sneeze, you 're ejecting fine particles,.
16192 16192 As a seller now, the downside is that you 'll probably see fewer buyers.
16195 16195 If stimulus is rightly structured to help these companies and if vaccine is discovered then the housing demand will roar back,.
16196 16196 If these factors are sustained in 2020, we will see a notable pickup in home sales in 2020.
16197 16197 Whether it is a reflection of politics or true economic conditions, there is a difference of views between rural and urban areas,.
16202 16202 It 's too hard to figure out who really needs it. Get money into everybody 's hands, then we can clean it all up later.
16206 16206 One of the things we will look at ahead at for the COP26 is ` should we have pathways to make the TCFD mandatory ?' Not overnight, but through listing requirements or securities regulation disclosure standards,.
16208 16208 delighted that the work of arguably the single most influential British artist of all time will now appear on another two billion works of art -- the new 20-pound notes that people can start using today.
16209 16209 In an environment where everything is getting a fresh look, it 's fertile ground for taking a step back and making bigger changes than otherwise might have been made,.
16210 16210 Should the MPC need to provide further monetary stimulus, there were a number of options at its disposal, including cutting Bank Rate further, enlarging the TFSME ( Term Funding scheme with additional incentives for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises ), and expanding asset purchases,.
16214 16214 financial institution, every ... pension fund or insurer : what 's your plan ?.
16216 16216 I do n't think the financial sector should be or will be a substitute for climate policy.
16217 16217 Similarly with school closures, he 's been clear there is no reason or need for schools en masse to close. If there are particular incidents, Public Health England and local teams will give advice.
16218 16218 I am concerned that the U.S. path may not be optimal because of job destruction -- the millions of jobs that are being destroyed -- some of them will not be recreated after the pandemic is over and shutdown is over,.
16219 16219 If you 're caught in a recession, and you ca n't get a job, it 's disastrous for you and the social consequences are huge from that sort of fallout,.
16220 16220 If unemployment gets lower you get wages growth starting to pick up because you get scarcity of labour,.
16223 16223 Medicaid funding will be used to pay for other programs or even to finance tax cuts.
16225 16225 Stalling for 10 years is n't good enough in a world where Australia 's on fire. In a global net-zero world, there wo n't be any demand for their product or enough offsets to counter the emissions they have,.
16228 16228 In China, decision making takes place at the top. The country 's leaders are skeptical, if not hostile, with regard to the value of multiparty democracy, but they have been strongly committed to eliminating hunger, illiteracy and medical neglect, and that is enormously to their credit.
16229 16229 Divisions between groups and sects not only damage social lives but they can also act as barriers to intellectual progress within and across the nations. Friendship is, in fact, central to the development of knowledge,.
16230 16230 When many businesses are undertaking great work to support the national effort, it 's crucial that companies such as JD Wetherspoon and Sports Direct do all they can ensure their workers are properly protected and get the pay to which they are entitled.
16232 16232 would be encouraging people to go out and buy cars and go to restaurants and get an airplane and take vacations,.
16233 16233 As an individual what I feel is that behind everything we do, whether we achieve it or not, we must have the intent to transform the realities and transform the world,.
16234 16234 There are a variety of indices we have got to be much to be proud of. This is being recognised globally and we should also be very pleased about it. Now the country should look ahead instead of being self-congratulatory and it is more productive to see what can be achieved in the future, and not, in fact, rest on our laurels.
16236 16236 In the next two to three weeks, if we act really decisively, we may be able to flatten the curve and then when the storm comes it will be not be as brutal as we see in Europe.
16237 16237 A strategy to silence the guns must be strategy to improve the governance of our societies, to build a more transparent decision-making process, to demand more inclusive and strong institutions underpinned by the rule of law. We have good examples of where these principles have helped countries.
16239 16239 We need to ensure that women are included in critical decision-making processes if we are to reduce conflict, sustain peace, and deliver a prosperous Africa.
16241 16241 Since most people do n't have a treadmill, outdoor exercise makes it a heck of a lot easier to meet the physical activity guidelines of 150 minutes a week of moderate activity, like walking, or 75 minutes a week of vigorous activity, like running,.
16246 16246 We 'll get in a ring and we 'll have a fight and you can all watch it on TV, what d ’ you think about that ?.
16248 16248 The student is made to feel committed to the program rather than have an open mind, because the tuition dollars will stop if they want to switch majors,.
16249 16249 Today the priority is containment, but to reach that you can rely not just on social isolation and shutdown, but fiscal measures, like sick pay and health spending, could help attain that goal more effectively,.
16250 16250 And in a lower-case scenario, you could see contraction for the first time in decades, and as many as 11 million people could be driven into poverty,.
16255 16255 Secondly, we will be looking to see whether there are any breaches of the act -- if there is any enforcement action to be taken. Thirdly, if when we have got transparency and we 've looked at the potential for enforcement under the act as is ... we make a judgement as to whether more regulation is needed.
16257 16257 Some people want to solve the problem straight away. I do n't think you can. It 's a bit of a journey.
16258 16258 Many consumers may have been tricked by these price displays into thinking they were getting great discounts. In fact, Trivago was n't comparing apples with apples when it came to room type for these room rate comparisons.
16260 16260 With the markets destroying wealth so quickly, the two shocks we 're seeing globally -- the coronavirus and the oil-price war -- could morph into a financial crisis,.
16269 16269 If men and women sort into field of study in systematically different patterns, it follows that major choice should affect the college gender wage gap.
16274 16274 No arrests have been made despite the lapse of 72 hours. This is deliberate irresponsibility. People who have been identified must be arrested. Also, normality can not return unless the vice-chancellor is removed. He should be sacked immediately.
16276 16276 All of us have individual ambitions. But right now there should be only one ambition -- the party 's revival, retention of support base and return to power,.
16278 16278 The outbreak of the coronavirus could drive large swings in Mainland China and emerging Asia growth in the first half but a much smaller impact on full-year growth, if the SARS episode is any guide,.
16279 16279 The stall in activity in March is likely sufficient to tip both economies into contraction this quarter but the shock 's impact is expected to be concentrated next quarter, where both regions are expected to contract at a double-digit annualized pace. These outcomes are worse than were recorded during the global financial crisis or the European sovereign crisis.
16280 16280 I do n't think it has to play out like 2008, 2009 where you had most longer-lasting problems unwound.
16281 16281 They are going to be out there working. If they do n't have access to healthcare and protective measures that other workers may have, then that 's making them particularly vulnerable,.
16282 16282 This would be a quick and direct way to contribute to all countries' capacity to contain the COVID-19 virus and avoid subsequent waves of contagion. SDRs would be a stabilizing force and an economic cushion for the global health emergency.
16285 16285 Right now bitcoin feels a little frenzied, and we could see it surge up, but I think by the end of the year we certainly take out the old highs,.
16289 16289 This support should continue throughout the containment phase to minimize persistent scars that could emerge from subdued investment and job losses in this severe downturn,.
16291 16291 But, we do have growth going back up to 5.8 percent in the following fiscal. But there are a couple of month 's stabilisation and then we should see a recovery.
16297 16297 As such we do n't expect a sudden or a big cut. Should he ( Kganyago ) have already cut by now ? It 's a good question. But it would be unorthodox for the Reserve Bank 's Monteary Policy Committee to meet more, or sooner than they already have -- but there is room for a cut,.
16298 16298 This will likely also increase job losses, with further consequences for aggregate demand. The impacts will be particularly severe for small businesses, and individuals with earnings in the informal sector,.
16304 16304 The early spring homebuying season clearly will be a bust, but things should improve in June if lockdowns are eased somewhat and people are able to visit new home developments. That said, the unfolding nightmare in the labor market has removed large numbers of potential homebuyers from the pool, so the market ca n't quickly return to the robust and rising trend in place before the virus,.
16306 16306 Looking at the states' unemployment claims numbers that have been coming out over the last few days, it looks to me like the order of magnitude in most states seems to be about 10 times higher than the normal weekly numbers before the crisis,.
16308 16308 They should be doing much more than they are thinking about and doing it much quicker, at least $ 2 trillion with the promise of more to come .... We have whole industries like the restaurant industry that have been obliterated already. Jobless claims next week could be two or three million.
16311 16311 Its equivalent in Australia would be a combination of ASIO, the Australian Federal Police, plus ASIS -- Australia 's overseas intelligence organisation -- all rolled into one, but with a lot more power and less subject to the constraints of the rule of law.
16319 16319 As we sit here today, and I believe this to be the case around the country, racing is continuing today. I think it will certainly continue tomorrow,.
16321 16321 We 're moving to fast-track the local production of ventilators, so that hospitals and health-care workers can continue their extraordinary efforts in caring for those of us who need it most.
16323 16323 But as we 've seen in many other parts of the economy at the moment, this thing is very changeable. We 're literally changing every few days. I think we enjoy it while we can.
16324 16324 I 'm sure the ICC and CA will be having all kinds of conversations with Commonwealth authorities and indeed with state authorities but if the question is right now as we sit in April ` is it a difficult proposition', yes, I think it probably is,.
16326 16326 Donald Trump is obsessed about China passing the U.S. in size of GDP. It already did by purchasing power parity, but thanks to his leadership, China is likely to have a larger GDP, measured in nominal dollars, than the U.S. next quarter.
16333 16333 The current decline in global emissions is not a development we should be happy about,.
16335 16335 would basically start to go about the business and the disruption is significant but minor.
16336 16336 We just ran the numbers carefully over the weekend, and we think the second quarter will be about minus-five percent, and we think the jobs number in early April might be as much as minus a million or so, because nobody is going to get hired next week.
16337 16337 I could imagine the Fed doing a very big move at the next meeting -- like 100 basis points -- if this looks like a very serious threat to the global economy.
16338 16338 The tax cuts reduced revenue by more than we thought in the first year ... the corporate taxes are losing revenue with the rate, but gaining revenue with all the international tax rules and the stuff that ca n't pay for itself is like the joint tax cord,.
16340 16340 If you control your own currency and you have bills that are coming due, it means you can always afford to pay the bills on time. You can never go broke ; you can never be forced into bankruptcy.
16342 16342 The commercials, or his ability to afford them, was, in some sense, the Bloomberg platform. They were his credentials. Precisely because he could buy this time, he was taken seriously. The Times did n't scrutinize him because they would have had to scrutinize what, to their minds, legitimized him. Money was the record he was running on.
16344 16344 The informal sector workers, without leave and any social security, will not be able to withdraw from daily work unlike the formal employees. This will put them at greater health risks. This health emergency should be taken as a lesson to ensure universal social security for all the workers,.
16346 16346 We looked at why that would happen, why is it that your wages would fall because your super grows, and the theoretical underpinning for that argument is very weak,.
16355 16355 I 'd be very surprised if we run out of anything at this point. My biggest concern, right now, is the border. If the border closes for one reason or another, that could be quite problematic for our global supply chains.
16356 16356 During the fourth quarter, the five largest stocks in the S & P 500 ( Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google ) posted an average earnings surprise of +20 %, compared with just 4 % for the average S & P 500 company. Any weakness to these and other companies would likely push earnings estimates lower,.
16357 16357 We think today 's pre-market softness is technical and is not likely to derail another mixed to positive session,.
16358 16358 Extending gas pipelines from the southern port of Asalouyeh in the Persian Gulf in Bushehr Province to neighbouring states has always been marred by political issues ( sanctions and wars ) and, in optimistic terms, may work only for a short term.
16359 16359 If the database of the behavioral sciences consisted entirely of Tsimane subjects, researchers would likely be quite concerned about generalizability,.
16360 16360 Once a week, we get on a conference call and we talk for 10 or 15 minutes about absolutely nothing. We just want to talk once a week to hear each other 's voices.
16367 16367 With the oil-producing regions of our economy already stressed, this shock can only deepen and prolong the adjustment process discussed earlier.
16370 16370 In determining the future path for the Bank 's policy interest rate, Governing Council will be watching closely to see if the recent slowdown in growth is more persistent than forecast,.
16371 16371 The main thing they need to do is cough up an enormous amount of money. I think they 'll get there.
16373 16373 There are questions as to whether we have the right education system and whether or not we can get jobs at big multinational companies due to the lack of proficiency in our language,.
16375 16375 We have been planning for the first positive case in Northern Ireland and have made clear that it was a question of when not if,.
16382 16382 We should not allow foreigners to enter our education sector. This will lead to the westernisation of education and will not be in the national interest.
16383 16383 Our organisation is in touch with private players. Many of them are also of the opinion that our industry must rise up to the occasion and produce APIs at home,.
16384 16384 There are so many issues regarding dairy, agriculture, medical equipment and IPR. There are previous concerns as well. For the past so many years these issues are pending and I do n't think in the near future there can be any trade deal with the US,.
16385 16385 What I 'm saying is within the context of the framework for deciding monetary policy we also have to look at the impact on stable employment and on stable prices. If other central banks engage in those unfair practices, it can effect employment, especially our manufacturers who have to compete.
16387 16387 If you look at the way economists were framing the debate, the assumption was bad things will happen around 2050, so how you discount costs and benefits 30 years into the future is a big deal,.
16388 16388 Many activities that had to be switched off can then be switched on again step by step, but some activities such as long-distance travel will be restrained for much longer. The fiscal stimulus will partly offset some hesitation by consumers and companies to spend,.
16394 16394 This does not mean that we can ignore our budgetary constraints, especially given that our revenues will also be severely affected this year.
16395 16395 When even elite universities become literal battlegrounds, accusations that the government is attempting to suppress dissent -- even if by apathy rather than design -- gain substantial credibility,.
16397 16397 Direct transfers to households may reach most but not all, as several commentators have pointed out,.
16399 16399 2019 will probably be the last year with ` oil boom' as a description of the economic situation,.
16400 16400 In a real financial panic, it 's very hard to raise money, because no one will accept anything but cash, and that does not seem to be what 's happening here. Quite the reverse,.
16401 16401 This ( wearing a homemade mask ) seems like a reasonable response unless you just sort of take American society out of it. When you ca n't do that, you 're basically telling people to look dangerous given racial stereotypes that are out there,.
16406 16406 What we do for a living, buying stakes in companies and working to make them more valuable, more efficient, more effective, I think it 's great for the shareholders, I think it 's great for the employees,.
16407 16407 After a careful review of the portfolio, we concluded that a hedging strategy was more consistent with our long-term ownership philosophy, and would likely lead to a better long-term outcome than selling off all of our assets.
16411 16411 even if their actual effectiveness is the same.
16413 16413 If you ask people what policies do they support for addressing climate change and reducing emissions, you hear things like renewable portfolio standards -- let 's set performance standards for industry -- and so you hear a lot more about standards,.
16414 16414 My primary responsibility is to you, to make sure you are safe, to make sure your families are safe, to make sure you can function where you are under the best possible conditions health and security wise,.
16420 16420 I think [ the interview ] is buried on a tape somewhere at ITV in the archives. And hopefully, it will never see the light of day,.
16423 16423 To us, this is the changing narrative, and this is the changing mindset we would like international development institutions should have ; that the way to intervene and support Africa.
16426 16426 because American agriculture clearly took a hit from China 's retaliation for U.S. tariffs .... I think the extent of it has been exaggerated, but certainly farmers were grumbling.
16431 16431 We think that the constructive nature of the meeting indicated that all four stakeholders are absolutely united in the determination to do what has to be done for Irish soccer, particularly from our point of view for the grassroots,.
16432 16432 Come the polling day I think the Independents will be very strong.
16436 16436 Establishing such an ambitious goal for waste reduction is paramount to ensuring a better world for future generations. Leading the wind industry is not enough to combat the global challenges we face today. If we are to spearhead the energy transition, we must be an example for doing so in the most sustainable way, and this involves making sustainability part of everything we do.
16438 16438 New eras are notoriously hard to predict. So instead of focusing on which cities are quarantined, start thinking about what 's next. Very few investors do.
16440 16440 Over the last 20 years, research has gradually accumulated suggesting that religious service attendance is associated with better physical and mental health.
16441 16441 Over the years, I have seen many obvious ` no-brainers' that would greatly enhance value and have worked hard to facilitate these, but I can say without exaggeration that the combination of HP and Xerox is one of the most obvious no-brainers I have ever encountered in my career -- one where activism should not even be necessary at all because the merits of the combination are so obvious to everybody involved,.
16444 16444 The total amount as per the list of students released to us comes to around Rs 31.74 crore for undergraduate students and Rs 1.32 crore for postgraduate ones. As the decision was taken before the elections and we have a new government in state, the release of funds is pending. We are unsure how the government plans to allot the funds -- annually or in lump sum,.
16445 16445 If any student is physically challenged, he/she would already have taken it into consideration while taking admission in the first year. There will hardly be any student who would want to seek a transfer in the second year,.
16446 16446 There was no imagination to see where something like this could come from.
16452 16452 It 's a change to get dressed up if you like, or not. You can walk the red carpet in your everyday clothes or dress up.
16456 16456 The models say the disease will come back once the restrictions are lifted. I hope that 's not correct, but I ca n't imagine why it would n't be,.
16457 16457 We are intimately interconnected with nature, whether we like it or not,.
16458 16458 We 're trying to understand to what extent there might be racial bias. So we want to capture what the officer perceives the individual is,.
16460 16460 can open in the fall,.
16468 16468 I think the best system is an auction system and not a market system. I do n't think we will go crudely as far as piling cash in a room but we will take the electronic route,.
16469 16469 It is hereby notified that the Minister of Finance and Economic Development has, in terms of section 235 of the Customs and Excise Act, made the following regulations ; ( 1 ) These regulations may be cited as the Customs and Excise ( Suspension ) ( Amendment ) Regulations 2020 ( No. 225 ),.
16475 16475 It always hid behind closed doors and white picket fences and state rooms. I think it 's just much more out in the open [ now ]. To evoke or express what antisemitism feels like or what racism feels like or any kind of ` other-ization,' this show was just more bold and vocal about it. I almost feel like we live in a time when people are more bold and vocal about it, so it 's almost caught up to what the show really is.
16479 16479 I think I 'd be comfortable with saying 1.5 [ % ] to 2.5 [ % ].
16480 16480 If we used more words to explain things, each word would carry less weight,.
16481 16481 We 're always looking for things where if we have a tool to be able to do it, and if we think it 's needed, we 're going to do it,.
16483 16483 Leveraging that can help you find a job.
16486 16486 The value coastal wetlands provide for storm protection is substantial and should be taken into account as policy makers debate the Clean Water Act,.
16487 16487 If states do have to recover by cutting back, then that will induce its own bit of headwind and it might induce its own kind of recession,.
16493 16493 What I am worried about is the young father who is not buying clothes or food for his family because he is addicted to this,.
16494 16494 are the result of different aspirations and distinct life choices or permit improvement of the standard of living and expansion of the opportunities available to the disadvantaged.
16495 16495 Forget what you think you know about money and read the true, absorbing tale told by Vivek Kaul in his thorough, but fascinating book, ` Easy Money'. A great read.
16499 16499 Nobody can tell us who to be friends with or who not to be friends with ; we will make that decision ourselves.
16500 16500 To achieve the Ghana Beyond Aid agenda, government must institute a system to avoid revenue leakages, and ensure that public officials are accountable to every state money they spend.
16503 16503 the software does n't get distracted or tired. It processes the video stream irrespective of what 's going on around it, so we think we get a higher-quality result out of it.
16504 16504 They almost certainly activated that network last week if not the week before,.
16506 16506 If a country had a bad epidemiological outcome, then their shocks were likely be a lot bigger than countries that were able to control it well,.
16507 16507 When people go to university, they can borrow against the government and pay it back when their incomes rise, we should be doing that in this case right across the economy,.
16508 16508 Quarantining affected people and reducing large-scale social interaction would be an effective response.
16515 16515 Empty seats at shows are not the problem -- it is what is happening in showrooms, the holdups in the supply chains and what they might mean,.
16518 16518 I guess the theory was to protect lots that could be developed with more units. They do n't let you have a granny flat because this plan is cheap and very easy if you have a lot where you can build more units because they want to exploit that possibility. Unfortunately, only investors with a lot of money can do that. No homeowners ... unless you 're rich.
16525 16525 Despite the challenging regulatory environment, growing antitrust scrutiny, ad targeting headwinds and transition to Stories [ short user-generated photo or video collections ], Facebook turned in a strong performance in 2019 and we believe the stock remains attractive,.
16531 16531 I mean, if it were close to home and I knew somebody and I could see their reactions and it was super bad, then it would obviously heighten my awareness,.
16532 16532 It is easier to separate someone from a job than to connect someone to a job. In recessions, the unemployment rate can go up very quickly and it comes down very slowly. The worry is that this will be like that.
16534 16534 It 's quite self-destructive in the sense of, ` I 've given up and I 've lost all control and if it comes out and I 'm destroyed, oh well, because I 'm not worth anything'.
16538 16538 Students should be taken in with or without documentation,.
16541 16541 But a day or two later, I 've thought they probably are n't big enough. That 's not to criticise what 's been put forward, just a recognition the pace of this is extraordinary.
16542 16542 I think the lesson from the last couple of years is it 's quite dangerous to get trapped in these risk-aversion news cycles because they do n't tend to last very long,.
16547 16547 In our view, 2019 demonstrated the continuous effectiveness of monetary policy, especially when easing is undertaken in a synchronised manner around the globe. The IMF estimates that global growth would have been 0.5 percentage point lower without global monetary policy stimulus. That is a powerful outcome in the face of heightened downside risks,.
16554 16554 Active investing comprises two main strategies. One is based on the expectations of the cash flow each asset can generate. The other responds to short-term movements and ignores fundamental value.
16555 16555 Because any information that comes out from the defendant could result in me being called as a witness in the case,.
16559 16559 Medicaid expansion made a big difference for low-income Americans in the states that chose to opt in, but it did so for all racial and ethnic groups, so it did not make a significant difference in how much the gap between whites and blacks or Hispanics closed,.
16562 16562 We have to make sure that we can get through what is going to be and is continuing to be a very, very, violent v [ shaped move ] in terms of GDP and economic growth in this country.
16566 16566 I was so stoked to have a movement coach help me with things like, you know, I 've never thought about how men walk,.
16567 16567 Spending on all of those categories has probably plummeted and much faster than our data system catches it.
16568 16568 They showed a misunderstanding of the level of complexity of Iran 's economy and how good they are or how experienced they are with resisting sanctions.
16570 16570 Not many people have been to prison or jail, even ministering ... and death row is even more of a mystery,.
16573 16573 Although three months' worth of progress may sound comparatively small to some people, it equates to more than 10 % of the three academic secondary school years measured -- from when these young people are aged 11 years old to 14, which we know is a hugely developmental period,.
16574 16574 I can reasonably assume Ronnie Preyer 's opinion : He 's against women being armed. Or he would be if this serial rapist was n't shot to death by a Cape Girardeau woman fighting to protect her body from his attack. After Preyer raped her the first time, she dutifully called the police. A few days later, he returned to attack her a second time. This time, instead of a phone, she used a gun to protect herself.
16575 16575 it does not appear that self-defense gun use is more effective at preventing injury than many other methods of resistance,.
16584 16584 if we just build a better environment.
16587 16587 We 've seen a big rise in seniors with debt and those seeking bankruptcy or consumer proposal.
16588 16588 A large number of countries in the European Union ensure that organisations that promote their trademarks [ ... ] are accompanied by very simple inscriptions : ` Do not give up your life to gambling', ` You can lose your family as well as your money'.
16589 16589 Even high-quality projects will struggle to get financing or refinancing, and that could have a ripple effect.
16590 16590 I do n't see foreign investors pulling out ( of Indian equity ) but we could see an impact on future flows if the issue escalates,.
16592 16592 I think it is important to take the time and do the analysis,.
16596 16596 But if the stock market is down at some time in the future, then risks are going up, and that increases risk in the system as a whole,.
16598 16598 Flat tyre or engine failure ? The Indian economy.
16599 16599 But the Brexit risk has only been postponed, as it seems impossible to have a comprehensive trade agreement that includes financial services in 11 months.
16602 16602 Hopefully they can learn a new skill, they can take it further on in life,.
16603 16603 I think there were too many thresholds and too many delays, but do think overall he 's done a good job.
16605 16605 At Shanghai Disney Resort, we currently estimate the closure of the park could have an adverse impact to second-quarter operating income of approximately US $ 135 million, assuming the park is closed for two months during Q2,.
16613 16613 A political clash is unavoidable. Not even centrist politicians in Rome can acquiesce any longer,.
16614 16614 For example, the green energy union that we do n't have and we should have. Public health and public education.
16619 16619 I did n't put it to one side because I thought it was nothing, it was because of who he was.
16620 16620 Major economies around the world are preparing stimulus packages. A well-designed stimulus package could offer economic benefits and facilitate a turnover of energy capital which have huge benefits for the clean energy transition.
16621 16621 Being the president of the G20 this year, one would expect that Saudi Arabia will provide a constructive support to the stabilisation of the global oil markets based on their past record,.
16623 16623 In the next chapter, [ financial ] stimulus into the clean-energy transitions that will boost economies and the resilience of our energy systems must be at the heart of those packages,.
16627 16627 At these prices we could see a halt to growth because many independent producers are already heavily indebted. But this situation could also lead to consolidation in the near future, which could bring further efficiency gains. The shale industry has proven its resilience again and again.
16632 16632 NATO currently has around 16,000 troops in Afghanistan and we are ready to adjust that force level if the Taliban is able to demonstrate the will and real ability to reduce violence and we see a path to peace,.
16646 16646 We may nail it, or we may miss it ; that does n't matter this time. What matters is buying into new positions, starting now, if you 're ready. If you 're not ready, get ready.
16651 16651 Or with other groups, there 's other groups looking at the present time, talking to me, talking to others to see if we would form an alliance. But the main thing is I suppose to get re-elected,.
16652 16652 The only way to respond to these needless deaths and injuries on our roads is through action not words. While families and friends grieve the loss of their loved one, we must as a society all respond with deeds, to prevent it happening to others,.
16654 16654 I was at the station at 7am this morning to welcome the Gardai. I have always stressed the need for community Gardai here and I praise the community for keeping the faith that the station would reopen,.
16659 16659 A family-operated restaurant in a tourism-reliant country, or the employees of a factory shut down because of a local quarantine will need support to weather the crisis.
16663 16663 Marginal tax rates can be raised without sacrificing economic growth.
16665 16665 It is too early to say, because we do n't yet quite know what is the nature of this virus. We do n't know how quickly China will be able to contain it. We do n't know whether it will spread to the rest of the world,.
16674 16674 The outlook for global growth is negative for 2020, and perhaps a worse recession is expected, as in the time of the global financial crisis. We expect recovery in 2021,.
16675 16675 What we can say for certain is we have moved into the territory of more dire scenarios ... as long as we do n't know the duration of this [ coronavirus ] outbreak, we 'll be in a higher uncertainty space,.
16677 16677 I reported to the G20 that even in the case of rapid containment of the virus, growth in China and the rest of the world would be impacted,.
16684 16684 We 've got to wait to see it. Meantime, you act as if it could be happening.
16685 16685 Governing Council stands ready to adjust monetary policy further if required.
16687 16687 There is a sense on Bay Street ( Toronto 's financial district ) that the Canadian economy is soft and that the Bank of Canada is more likely to cut rates than hike, yet nothing we have heard from the Bank of Canada has confirmed that,.
16690 16690 If households have run down their savings and had to dip into retirement savings, or are behind on their bills, and have higher debt and lower wealth, their spending patterns are not likely to go back to what they were.
16691 16691 would not completely rule out the use.
16692 16692 I think a ` V' is possible, but I am worried that the outcome will be worse and it really depends to my mind on just how much damage is down during the time that the economy is shut down in the way it is now,.
16693 16693 could be threatened by what strikes me as an increasing tendency for participants to take strong stands in public on ongoing debates about appropriate policy,.
16694 16694 If this pandemic continues, we might have to do it again in a month,.
16695 16695 The first step is to find the kind of a desired state that we want and achieve. Then from there we say who should be in the driving seat for the alliance. I am not desperate for a position. My motivation is to ensure that the mission to rescue Malawi is accomplished,.
16696 16696 It will not make sense to go it alone and then later hold a run off election because we have failed to secure the 50 plus 1 majority vote. It is better to join hands now so that we win with a 60 plus 12 percent majority vote [ Malawians should be governed by a president elected by a majority of voters ],.
16699 16699 The future has a lot of uncertainty. It can be good or it can be bad. Education is a way to prepare us with the ability to cope with our challenges and grasp opportunities for betterment.
16700 16700 You can not explain the very high shares of kids from high-income families solely by saying they are the ones who have higher test scores,.
16702 16702 For shipping, costs are also already on the rise. IMO2020, which requires vessels to use low sulphur fuels, has already kicked in and whether or not shipping companies are able to pass the costs through to customers ( which so far has been the case, but it is too soon to de-risk it ) could affect earnings.
16705 16705 It was the moment consecrated in time and memory that I sought to make good on doing my part -- however big or however small -- to ensure the promise of ` Never Again,'.
16710 16710 I think ` Once' is the most unique song on that record,.
16711 16711 I intend to retire as solo artist after album no3 as I have just had a call from my brother begging me to start Oasis again in 2022 if you believe in life after love c'mon you know LG x. [ sic ].
16718 16718 The engagement of those proposition bets, either streaming down the side of the screen or as a crawl along the bottom, and you 'll have some type of interactivity -- I think that will bring people further into the game, but is going to require us to get even better at collecting data from the field so that we can create very interesting and unique proposition bets.
16728 16728 We expect to see one or two quarters of impact on growth from coronavirus. Prospect is that coronavirus will cause disruption, not destruction to the economy.
16733 16733 The direct cost of the health intervention, I do n't think is huge. Now if there is a big recession, the lost revenue from that will be a big issue.
16745 16745 These various responses are providing considerable support to Australian households and businesses through what is a very difficult period. The Australian financial system is resilient. It is well capitalised and in a strong liquidity position, with these financial buffers available to be drawn down if required to support the economy,.
16754 16754 When officers of the administrative service resign their dream jobs because they do not believe they can serve in good faith, they are living testimony that the sacrifices made by the generations that got us freedom still inspire emulation,.
16755 16755 We need to spend money on medical supplies, ventilators, masks -- on getting protective equipment for medical workers. That means getting every resource in -- be it private, public, defence or retired. And quickly. All this will require fiscal resources and this is the higher priority,.
16758 16758 If, however, the government insists on driving everything from the Prime Minister 's Office, with the same overworked people, it will do too little, too late,.
16763 16763 Consumers should respond immediately when contacted by their manufacturer. Sometimes manufacturers will not have the latest contact information for the owners of these cars, so people who suspect their cars are affected should contact the manufacturer themselves,.
16764 16764 The ACCC 's concern was that with this merger, mobile data prices will be higher than they would be otherwise.
16765 16765 operate in an already concentrated market, and not many other mortgage aggregators offer a similar level or type of service.
16766 16766 The ACCC can not control the petrol prices companies set, but we can call out problematic price-setting, which can influence company behaviour,.
16770 16770 825 biggest companies in Seattle would pay the tax.
16772 16772 Considering the pace of change driven by the fourth industrial revolution, we must invest in re-directing and re-skilling our labour force. We must, and we will, prepare young people for the jobs of the future, not the jobs of the past,.
16775 16775 Even relative to some of our new policy rate forecasts, we think the risk is on the downside, at least in terms of timing. Specifically, we see a high risk that the easing we expect over the next several weeks occurs in coordinated fashion, perhaps as early as the coming week,.
16777 16777 If you were to ask what 's the one thing we really know from suicide research in the US, that would be it,.
16780 16780 That would seem to suggest that the net effect of higher prices on the U.S. would be to depress economic growth, but recent experience points in the opposite direction, because oil sector capital expenditure, in the era of shale, is acutely sensitive to prices, even in the short term.
16781 16781 As a share of the workforce, jobless claims have never been lower ; the weekly data extend back to 1948. The stability of the trend should mean that it is relatively easy to identify a change after the emergence of the coronavirus ; we are braced for an up-shift in the next couple of months,.
16782 16782 Under normal circumstances it 's an insane policy which can lead to hyper-inflation,.
16784 16784 Everywhere you would look for reassurance, for leadership, for policy action, for reliable information -- all are absent.
16788 16788 Total layoffs between the March and April payroll surveys look destined to reach perhaps 16 to 20 million, consistent with the unemployment rate leaping to 13 to 16 per cent. In one month.
16789 16789 Slower productivity growth constrains the real component of nominal wage growth. At the same time, people have been very reluctant to push for bigger pay increases, probably as a consequence of the trauma inflicted by the crash of 2008.
16790 16790 Iran right now is reeling from the assassination, but the leadership is dominated by hardliners and the question is how, not whether, they will respond. For markets, the key issue is the impact of the Iranian response on oil prices,.
16794 16794 Our job is to study and recommend. We can not and should not step into the domain of the executive,.
16797 16797 The Congress should not outsource its thinking. It should think on its own,.
16801 16801 can not be considered the template for future trade negotiations.
16803 16803 came expecting that the Republicans would come out all guns blazing and fire and brimstone, and I think they got a message from some of their Republican brethren that that would not be helpful.
16804 16804 We 're not going away from this debate. We just could not criminalize such a broad activity,.
16805 16805 Thankfully, the explosion did not result in the large-scale release of hydrofluoric acid, which could have caused mass casualties.
16807 16807 The results suggest that if the carbon dioxide level increases by 1 percent, floods and storms would increase by nearly 9 percent,.
16813 16813 We may have a wide range of geopolitical shocks between the US and China, global cyber warfare,.
16816 16816 The Health System We 'd Have if Economists Ran Things,.
16823 16823 To use a rule of thumb, if the product you 're making is less valuable than the offsets, then that 's a bad sign,.
16835 16835 Why the coronavirus could threaten the U.S. economy even more than China 's.
16837 16837 We need to reduce the cost of doing business : the cost of doing business can actually affect everybody. I can tell you the truth, the government lost so much money last year in the traffic logjam of Apapa alone. We as a company, our three companies lost over N30 billion in terms of profits, which means the government will also collect less taxes. So we need to look at infrastructure, we need to look at power.
16838 16838 the Bonds would deliver increased visibility for issuers, as cross-listing improves the green bond issuers' access to a deep pool of green capital domestically and internationally.
16841 16841 Here, more or less, the administration is basically saying, ` Please start recklessly lending,.
16843 16843 If you look beyond the 4.50 per cent there are indicators that things can go even worse in the immediate-run,.
16848 16848 The economic growth in Germany could be somewhat lower than estimated in December,.
16849 16849 To some extent, markets are used to turbulence in the Middle East. It usually hurts global confidence, growth and markets only if it drives up oil prices significantly on a sustained basis,.
16855 16855 You can not teach those things. The law school should be proud of these students and all of the professors who work hard with law students in their clinical programs. The University of Wyoming law school is accepting and turning out the right kind of lawyers.
16856 16856 Can you feel it in your toes ... ?.
16859 16859 Even a policymaker who declares that surprising the markets wo n't deter her from following appropriate policy might find that this declaration is not time consistent when faced with such a choice,.
16860 16860 Appropriate actions taken by other parties, including global public health officials and fiscal authorities, would likely do more to support confidence and spending,.
16863 16863 obviously, a better number would have been very welcome, but I think it 's very consistent with what we 've been seeing.
16865 16865 Moving your investments to cash may sound safe, but placing it all in cash or a money market account that earns little and is eroded by inflation is certainly not safe.
16869 16869 There is certainly a lesson for having a safety net so that so that if you 're facing a pandemic, you could treat everyone and really have a framework [ so ] people are n't afraid to come in and you can treat everyone,.
16870 16870 You do n't have enough money to buy stuff and the government makes a transfer to you, that 's great -- but not if you 're hiding under the bed.
16871 16871 Though we cut the corporate tax rate, we will widen our tax base and maximise our spending so that there is no economic shock. This must be maintained because there is a global economic slowdown,.
16872 16872 We are prepared to put on an amazing show and get everything ready with what should be an amazing matchup between two great teams,.
16873 16873 You can hear it around us. And there 's a lot more work to go.
16877 16877 We must keep our footprint as small as we can and limit the number of people in one place to protect the health and well-being of our people and keep our industry viable during these unprecedented times,.
16879 16879 But you would expect to see that there 'd be not just inbound effects, but outbound effects.
16884 16884 an unprecedented global shock, which could bring growth to a halt and could increase poverty across the region,.
16890 16890 This would make integration into the labor market about a year quicker than we had noticed with earlier refugee movements to Germany,.
16891 16891 If a different name is used & especially a name typically used by different religions will send a Legal Notice.
16892 16892 The government needs to clarify if IB officer Sharma was targeted and killed at the behest of AAP 's Tahir because Sharma was tailing him for Tahir 's Bangladesh terrorists connection. If true it becomes very very serious matter,.
16893 16893 If you were to suggest following the Indonesian practice for the rupee which God you will choose ?.
16895 16895 If the president decides to go 180 on us and open by Easter, that will create chaos and confusion. That is the prescription for a depression,.
16896 16896 There are numerous reports of laid-off workers unable to file for unemployment insurance because so many people are trying to file at the same time. Millions of job losses are likely in coming weeks.
16898 16898 Unemployment on Election Day is going to be high single digits. If he 's lucky, it will be five or six percent,.
16899 16899 If the economy slows to a degree we start seeing job losses, the mortgage rates wo n't be enough to offset the ill effects of that weakness,.
16900 16900 It may very well be needed.
16904 16904 They 're going to rely on the impossibility of monitoring that to get away with wholesale violations, because I just can not imagine that anything the Chinese sign will be remotely verifiable.
16905 16905 but it 's very difficult to see where 's there 's been a major downturn, or frankly any downturn at all. There was definitely a soft patch in the middle of 2019 and you can also see signs in these figures that manufacturing, at least as it 's measured by these durable goods orders, is slowly, but surely, moving out of that soft patch.
16907 16907 I do n't think you can just give psilocybin alone,.
16909 16909 I think two months ago, they had announced a policy rate cut. So, the RBI has to consider what is the best thing for the country at the moment and they will decide,.
16917 16917 With the world at such a critical crossroads, this year we must develop a ` Davos Manifesto 2020' to reimagine the purpose and scorecards for companies and governments,.
16920 16920 The die is already cast on your government and, if you continue as you have been doing, time will not be your friend,.
16922 16922 Tech companies have done a lot of great things, but they seem to be saying everyone should just trust them and democratically elected governments do n't really have a role,.
16923 16923 research would dry up.
16925 16925 This virus and the economic downdraft likely accelerate adjustments to global trade that were going to take place anyway,.
16931 16931 This rally in equity markets is probably too far too fast, and there are probably still downside risks from here,.
16932 16932 Investors have largely taken the view that the impact will be temporary, hopefully short-lived, and that most of the weakness should be reversed with a strong rebound in the quarters that follow,.
16936 16936 There were moments in the season where you really had to prepare ( to be a champion ). If we did n't have Calgary, I guess we had the Flyers and the Islanders, but you only played them twice a year. It was in-season playoff training, and hardening and all that stuff.
16937 16937 His approval rating is still lower than it should be with a president with this type of record of accomplishment,.
16940 16940 We figured that because there was n't any other, we might as well call it the nationals,.
16941 16941 As we can see already with the trade war between the United States and China, commercial policy is going to be an important tool within this great power competition,.
16942 16942 If they do that, then I reckon a lot of sins will be forgiven,.
16951 16951 I do n't think when you ask folks they 're pricing in that rate cut, even though market pricing might suggest that,.
16952 16952 I think there actually is a lower bound for the policy rate,.
16954 16954 So we will get to 8 per cent but I think if we want to get to that extra 2 per cent to 10 per cent, then we need an economy which is open, competes in the global marketplace,.
16957 16957 I do n't think we 're at the absolute bottom yet because the implications of this shutdown are incredible,.
16959 16959 If people have done very well for themselves, I do n't see any great need to give them an award.
16963 16963 Therefore, additional escalation in US-Iranian tensions could further boost gold prices. All in all, we stick with our three, six and 12-month forecast of $ 1,600 / toz but see upside risks if geopolitical tensions worsen.
16965 16965 Absent treatments or vaccines, the only way to acquire immunity is to become infected and recover,.
16967 16967 I was not looking for this fight, but once I heard repeated, credible reports from disgusted whistleblowers that Mr. Nygard was abusing young, vulnerable women, I could not ignore this disturbing information.
16968 16968 What if many investors actually realize that ... illiquid, very infrequently and inaccurately priced investments made them better investors as essentially it allows them to ignore such investments' given low measured volatility and very modest paper drawdowns ? ... What if investors are simply smart enough to know that they can take on a lot more risk ( true long-term risk ) if it 's simply not shoved in their face every day ( or multi-year period ! ) ?.
16969 16969 Everyone miscalculated to a degree, but Russia expected a mild contraction and still thought they could gain market share.
16970 16970 I could have got a hat-trick. It was a dream come true against the best team in the world. Going to Anfield is what it 's all about,.
16971 16971 In the long run, I think the markets will come back. But do n't ask me how long I think the long run is,.
16974 16974 I believe that if we recommend to Pope Francis, that with his leadership which is unique in the world, we will go out to find these funds, each of us will go knock on the door of our favorite billionaire, of our next door neighbors, people who can make a difference, we will get this done, even by May.
16978 16978 I have always thought of myself as fundamentally a curious child,.
16979 16979 If we 're looking at five years out or more I think these levels are probably still attractive. For a short-term trade, I 'd probably say we 're a little bit pricey right now,.
16986 16986 They must come and help train teachers, educate students and give them support, offer them internship opportunities, then they can be good enough for them,.
16987 16987 We are saying that those with free funds can apply for passports in Foreign Currency. We can not dictate how people use their free funds,.
16992 16992 For some companies, that will translate into siginificant hiring. For others, it 's probably less due to their product or service.
16995 16995 I think you have to make the colleges a very central part of this. They have also been tremendously weakened and one of the things we said in our [ Augar ] review was that the government had to stop doing this and had to put money back in.
16996 16996 I wish we could give a firm date for this celebration now, but I ask for your patience,.
16998 16998 If there is a need to intervene in the area of government bonds, measures will be taken,.
17000 17000 Phunware 's enterprise cloud platform can deliver the digital transformation initiatives that Fortune 1000 companies must have in order to stay competitive in a mobile-first world.
17004 17004 We need a consensus among managers, academics and policy-makers that this is a problem on the scale of global warming, preserving biodiversity, or pursuing gender equality.
17007 17007 There has been a real effort to get the economy moving forward, and the worst of the shutdown is likely passed. Since the data confirms, more or less, what investors had envisioned from photos and anecdotes, there may not be an adverse reaction to the news,.
17011 17011 Negative interest rates may also come to Norway,.
17013 17013 There must be no special rules for the access to the EU single market.
17014 17014 if we want to assure Iran it will benefit from not pursuing nuclear weapons we must establish a state-run oil trading organization.
17018 17018 It 's supposed to be a dependable store of value,.
17019 17019 probably are not yet dematerializing.
17021 17021 Revolution Church really focuses on life on mission which means helping the community you 're in. So, we really try to pour into those communities and help wherever we can, whatever need we can meet ... we meet,.
17023 17023 These systems are very difficult to secure, it 's very difficult to guarantee any sort of anonymity or chain or custody around the vote such that you have strong auditability,.
17026 17026 My greatest fear going into this election cycle is that we would have a bruising battle for the nomination and we would spend so much of our energy and so much of our resources on an internal party battle that by the time the convention rolled around we would be out of money and out of energy,.
17028 17028 We are all being asked to do our bit and if every Australian is conscious of minimising the risk to older Australians then we will see this through with limited consequences,.
17033 17033 I think the issue is not that we should not borrow ; we should borrow with care and if you look at our bit surplus, for example, were around 2billion dollars net. So, your challenge is to get appropriately priced funds at the right time to be able for you to do your transformation exercise which will then generate your resources,.
17035 17035 Not that that would erase all the challenges of being in predominantly White spaces, where your scholarship and your person may be challenged, but it can create some kind of outlet.
17038 17038 While new risks could emerge, none of the main sources of recent recessions -- oil shocks, inflationary overheating, and financial imbalances -- seem too concerning for now,.
17039 17039 At this point in time, I suspect there are many thousands of individual cases in Northern Ireland.
17040 17040 For instance, there 's no skip on Sule Skerry, and certainly nowhere you can safely dispose of any large metal objects. And of course, there was the wildlife issue of which we needed to be very mindful.
17042 17042 hobbled severely by the non-existence of a fiscal Europe, and specifically by the absence of a fiscal authority, fiscal facility, or fiscal arrangement that can recapitalize it should it suffer losses due to credit risk assumed as part of its monetary, liquidity, or credit-enhancing policies.
17045 17045 The Fed 's decision to cut its rate target by 50 bps is not surprising : for some days markets have been expecting a deeper cut than that ; consequently had the Fed not announced a cut the decision would have amounted to disappointing news, which would have fueled further panic,.
17047 17047 This dedicated block has a separate entry and exit. Other blocks in the area are currently under construction. All facilities including water, power and the lift is currently available. The completion process is on and we are trying to meet the requirements of the district administration. They will first check if it is fit for the purpose. Also, there may be a possibility that the project is granted a temporary occupation certificate for the project to be used as a quarantine facility,.
17048 17048 We are in a very difficult moment, and many do n't have the tools to deal with it. We need to think about the future and help people prepare better, not just for a macro shock which no one can face alone of this proportion, but more of the smaller shocks life is full of and that have implications for our society, implications for how resilient it is,.
17049 17049 You do n't want to overly feed the darkness, but if you seem like all you do is happy talk then you lose credibility,.
17051 17051 The sales department is working more remotely, but they have to come to the office for documents. The main requirement is to have at least two staff at the office if there are calls, etc .. Clients are also asking to cancel personal meetings.
17055 17055 But businesses ca n't pay wages if they 're being forced to shut down and have no revenue coming in the door,.
17057 17057 A short-term ( 12-18 months ) increase in fiscal deficit will be accepted by capital markets, if they can be convinced that gains from efficiency and voluntary compliance will reduce the fiscal deficit over the next few years,.
17058 17058 The question I have been getting about COVID-19 is whether you should switch now to planning a home birth,.
17060 17060 He was a great entertainer. He had a toxic tongue and would tell people what he really thought, but people loved him.
17063 17063 We are now trying to build an inclusive economy. But this will not be materialised by creating a bar on access to finance to the SME sector. We should rethink the whole process to implement the capping of interest rates.
17066 17066 It was weird that the crime branch team asked us to give in writing if the attack was recorded on the CCTV cameras installed in the library. How can we saythat ?.
17068 17068 limited, and we continued to protect the most vulnerable, that may be acceptable for now. Also, let 's see what happens in the next two-three weeks. We can also keep an eye on China as they begin to relax restrictions there.
17069 17069 Spending on all of those categories has probably plummeted and much faster than our system catches it.
17079 17079 For pre-retirees, even if you 've got just one year until retirement, it 's okay to have a substantial amount in stocks. Do n't sell now. Give them time to come back,.
17080 17080 If the bias against immigrants is already high ... even a small over-estimation of the share of free-loaders among immigrants can tilt preferences towards less redistribution. Similarly, if the bias against immigrants is high ( or if the perceived share of free-loaders is high ), even a small overestimation of the share of immigrants can reduce support for redistribution.
17081 17081 So, even if the coronavirus crisis leads to a deep meltdown in terms of production, the chances of getting out of this recession rather sooner than later are much better than in the global financial crisis.
17083 17083 We know Zero Hunger will not be achieved just by giving people food. This is why our programmes work to empower women so they can be financially self-sufficient and make their own decisions. By giving women and men an equal voice and an equal say on issues affecting their families and communities we can eradicate hunger and malnutrition,.
17084 17084 [ t ] he Parties acknowledge that purchases will be made at market prices based on commercial considerations and that market conditions, particularly in the case of agricultural goods, may dictate the timing of purchases within any given year,.
17085 17085 Buffett figuratively took her ( Vicki Hollub, CEO of Occidental Petroleum ) to the cleanest. The Buffett deal was like taking candy from a baby and amazingly she even thanked him publicly for it ! But you ca n't blame Warren, if Hollub was arrogant enough to negotiate a deal with Buffett of this magnitude despite her admittedly limited experience in M & A and the Board enough to rubber stamp it, then one might say in Warren 's defense that it was almost his fiduciary duty to Berkshire Hathaway to accept it.
17087 17087 International exchange and study abroad can be truly life-changing,.
17089 17089 Some pharmacies have increased prices to between 70 and 100 rubles ( $ 1.59 ) whereas a mask would sell for 1.5 rubles before the New Year,.
17090 17090 will gather data necessary to enable health professionals to answer a few questions : What drugs, at what dosages when administered, are effective in treating or preventing the COVID-19 virus ?.
17092 17092 So, you can imagine the weather conditions, the waves crashing into the life boats.
17094 17094 The objective of having an independent Commission is unique. The Commission has the function of representing the general interest. If you touch that, you modify the fundamental pillars of the EU architecture,.
17095 17095 To effectively win this agenda, we must ensure that as we import the arms, the arms are for peace and not to ensure that war continues.
17097 17097 could not think of something that would be worse than having the University refuse to bargain with a legally certified union.
17098 17098 how do you keep the economy in a position where, when the virus goes away, we can recover quickly ? We need to avoid a permanent loss of capital and business knowledge.
17099 17099 sticking a high-tech institute in the middle of rural Idaho might not have multiplier effects if there is nothing to build on.
17101 17101 Whenever the next economic downturn or major risk market drawdown hits, policymakers will have even less policy capacity to maneuver, thus limiting their ability to fight future recessionary forces,.
17106 17106 gives us a baseline to watch, and look, and evaluate -- and then we 'll determine whether policy moves -- one way or the other -- going forward,.
17107 17107 It appears that the move [ by the Fed ] rather frustrated investors who were expecting a more creative, or impactful action than a simple rate cut, which they thought would n't remedy to disrupted supply chain problems,.
17110 17110 We are assuming that if China 's and global growth are going to be corrected downward then Indonesia is going to be affected.
17113 17113 It has been a difficult journey to get to this place, where we can finally heave a sigh of relief knowing that Irish football has a secure future.
17116 17116 This is the policy we need to have. We should have had it three weeks ago, but it 's good to see it moving.
17117 17117 We are looking at the things we only get from the census and whether it is possible to get them from other sources,.
17122 17122 The concern is whether we will spend another decade doing worthy things but not enough,.
17126 17126 would be lower than it otherwise would be, and that has a knock-on effect on the UK.
17127 17127 can create money instantly by allowing overdrafts or opening credit facilities.
17130 17130 West Bengal was supposed to get GST compensation of Rs 2,406 crore for January. But we did n't get that. We are afraid we may not get the GST compensations for February and March. Moreover, the Centre is depriving West Bengal of its due share of taxes ( from the divisible pool ).
17135 17135 Now consumption is at the center-stage and if we can get that going, investment will pick up after a few quarters,.
17136 17136 My expectation would be that government does expand on the disinvestment programme and raise a lot of revenue through asset sales. Government, on one side should relax taxes and spur consumption and on the other side, try and sell assets to raise revenues for fresh investments into infrastructure. This should be the two-pronged approach for the annual budget. I hope they follow-through on this,.
17141 17141 The market 's probably going to overreact in one way or another and I do n't think we can trust the authorities to get it right either,.
17142 17142 If you have a position that can lose 1 to make 100, like Universa 's tail hedge at any point in time, you do n't care about your timing of a market crash, you just do n't want to miss it.
17143 17143 Then we talk about her relationship -- and the vibe changes ` I 'm waiting for him to propose.'' I do n't want to pressure him.'' I hope I 'll be engaged soon.' It seems to me that many women take charge of their lives in every way except dating and marriage.
17144 17144 We want to be the place that people distribute information. Everyone in this crisis has a responsibility to do what they can do. We are really actively trying to get the right information to the right people.
17145 17145 And, you know, obviously that 's super unfair. I think I 'm helping people remember that dating, for those who want to do it, is part of moving forward, and it is option B. If I could I would only date Dave. I made that choice. I made that choice. I just had that taken away from me.
17146 17146 Women get judged much more harshly than men for dating after the loss of their spouse. I think I 'm helping people remember that dating, for those who want to do it, is part of moving forward, and it is option B.
17151 17151 There 's always a reaction to say, ` OK, we 've learned from this.' Companies will learn, just as consumers will learn, to stockpile things if all of a sudden they 're frightened because they could n't find something. The question is : What 's the half-life of that fear factor ?.
17152 17152 Modern companies have different vertical suppliers around the world. It could be the input that 's not being produced in China -- because of the disease -- is n't making its way to a factory in Thailand, which then goes to Brazil and then comes to the U.S.,.
17154 17154 I remember after 2007, 2008, when the interest rate on regular deposits in banks went down so much that a lot of young people, in particular in the the U.S., said, ` Why should I save ?.
17165 17165 urgently seeking $ 18 billion in new loan resources for the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust, and would also likely need at least $ 1.8 billion in subsidy resources.
17170 17170 We must act at par with the magnitude of the challenge. For us at the IMF it means working with you to make our crisis response even stronger. For this we ask your backing to double our emergency financing capacity and boost global liquidity through a sizeable SDR ( Special Drawing Right ) allocation, as we successfully did during the 2009 global crisis and by expanding the use of swap type facilities at the Fund.
17172 17172 Even a month of reduction in activities inevitably would have an impact on China and some of it would be translated to the rest of the world,.
17182 17182 Fasten your seat belt, I certainly would n't loosen it now,.
17183 17183 If I want to do this for a long time, I want to have big pile of money on the side so can continue growing even in down markets,.
17185 17185 If I had one piece of advice for you,.
17187 17187 Let 's see if dads step up to the plate and do 50-50,.
17193 17193 She does this because she had such a difficult life. Because she does n't want others to feel alone, gaslit, or ashamed the way she has.
17194 17194 I guess it was about him staying relevant. If you 're him, what else is there to tweet about ? How his spring/summer collections are doing for his clothing firm ?.
17197 17197 The wild card is whether turmoil in the Middle East triggers a sustained sell-off in equities, depressing business and consumer confidence to the point where labour market and inflation concerns become secondary,.
17198 17198 We hope the Empire State and ISM numbers will now move back into line, because that implies the latter will dip only to 46 or so in March but if the recent gap between them persists, the ISM will plummet to just 40 or so, meltdown territory - the post-2008 crash low was 34.5. - and there 's no guarantee that will be the bottom,.
17200 17200 If this continues for just two more weeks, the death toll will breach [ 10,000 ] by Easter. The president 's talk yesterday of re-opening the economy and seeing ` packed' churches by Easter is a fantasy.
17202 17202 January 's jump in payrolls likely will be followed by a significantly smaller increase in February, as favorable weather effects fade and healthcare job growth reverts,.
17203 17203 Upside risks over the first half of this year center on medical care, rent, and pehaps modest tariff pass-through in some components where tariffed Chinese imports have large market shares. The overall story for now, though, remains that core inflation is under control. It 's not low enough to suggest that the Fed needs to ease, but it 's a long way from suggesting they need to tighten,.
17204 17204 We would be hopeful of further progress if it were n't for the coronavirus, but that progress now will be delayed, likely by several months, at least.
17206 17206 I think they should be just throwing money at people and businesses that are in the front line. Cash has to be given out to households. Cash has to be given out to small businesses. Cash has to be given out to gig workers. I do n't know what the figures are for Uber drivers, but they are probably catastrophic.
17211 17211 All else equal, this would imply a short-lived global contraction that stops short of an outright recession,.
17214 17214 We have our doubts about whether Saudi Arabia will allow itself to be persuaded so easily to return from the path of revenge that it only recently embarked upon,.
17217 17217 Weak economy and the coronavirus is a problem for all of us. If they do n't do it, the citizens of this world will not forget it.
17218 17218 Oil prices remain heavy on oversupply concerns and after the Saudi Energy Minister Price Abdulaziz did not offer any hints of optimism that the Opec + production cuts would be extended beyond March,.
17225 17225 While Hunters is a dramatic narrative series, with largely fictional characters, it is inspired by true events. But it is not documentary. And it was never purported to be. In creating this series it was most important for me to consider what I believe to be the ultimate question and challenge of telling a story about the Holocaust : how do I do so without borrowing from a real person 's specific life or experience ?.
17229 17229 I suspect if we had everyone going to school in the dark we would have a lot more problems,.
17234 17234 There 's a massive exploration going on right now, seeking out what can be done virtually. So there may be a permanent effect on in-person meetings in the business world, and frankly, it 's a whole lot cheaper.
17237 17237 For instance, some international students will not be able to return home at this time ; some students may be unable to access online classes in their home location ; some may need to stay in Madison for other reasons,.
17242 17242 If somebody wants to say we did n't eat it, we just stared at it or made statues out of it, whatever,.
17245 17245 Lots of people, if they do n't lose their jobs, are going to get substantial pay cuts in a potentially much more widespread way than the financial crisis.
17248 17248 If we get inflation that would be good. That would be a good sign that we have adequate demand.
17250 17250 The future of finance will be much more quantitative than it is today. We are moving much more in that direction whether it is systematic or discretionary trading, machine learning is here to stay,.
17251 17251 Unemployment insurance, at least short term, is quite generous so the firms may decide that that 's a better way to go,.
17252 17252 If it does n't hit in a substantial way in the United States, that 's less likely. We had a pretty solid outlook before this happened -- and there is some risk, but basically I think the U.S. outlook looks pretty good.
17253 17253 We think it has a compelling economic logic,.
17254 17254 We are really focused on the structure of the economy post coronavirus. We will take it into account and see where it is relevant, it might not always be, but it may be occasionally.
17255 17255 The average price in 2020 is $ 5.35, the average price for 2021 delivery is $ 7, so the forward markets are pretty soft not just for one year but for two years, and I think beyond,.
17257 17257 This is a stressful time for everyone, but especially those working at the frontline of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It 's sadly understandable that such workers may consider life insurance coverage at this time.
17259 17259 In the very rare case of misuse, donations are backed by the industry 's only guarantee. The GoFundMe guarantee ensures donations reach the right place or will be refunded.
17260 17260 Implications publicly made to allow Virgin to go under, I just think that 's unhelpful,.
17261 17261 We may not know when the gains from CDR will kick in, but we can be certain they will be profound. Competition, consumers, and the economy will be benefit considerably,.
17262 17262 Rather than reacting to a phone call or text or someone approaching you on the web who you do n't know, it 's best you find their actual website and donate directly,.
17265 17265 There are still a lot of people getting infected but the infection rate is coming down, so if that continues, I think we can have reasonable optimism that the number of cases has stabilised,.
17266 17266 It seems that there is a global norm for hurdle rates somewhere around the 13 to 14 per cent mark and it is hard to shift this norm, even at record low interest rates,.
17267 17267 In part, the variation in interest rates paid by different borrowers reflects their creditworthiness or the riskiness and features of loans. In addition, it reflects the different interest rates offered by different lenders,.
17268 17268 They will have access to additional funding if they increase lending to business, especially to small and medium-sized businesses. This facility is for at least $ 90bn,.
17269 17269 This is a priority issue for us. Many small businesses are going to find coming months very difficult as their sales dry up and they support their staff. Assisting small businesses through this period will help us build that bridge to the other side when the recovery does take place. If Australia has lost lots of otherwise viable businesses through this period, making that recovery will be harder,.
17282 17282 I did n't grab Ms K 's backside but should have been more aware that she did n't want to have her picture taken.
17285 17285 It pleads not guilty to all charges and explains some of the circumstances in which they 've come about. I 'm also conscious we 're in the middle of a general election campaign. I 'm not going to say anything which would influence that democratic process.
17286 17286 Everybody is welcoming the trade deal. I think it 's important that we try and understand the trade deal first, and then we are made aware of what phase two is,.
17287 17287 FIDE can not continue the tournament without guarantees for the players' and officials' safe and timely return home. In this situation and on the basis of clause 1.5. Rules of Candidates Tournament, the FIDE president decided to stop the tournament.
17289 17289 Productivity has been inching up, but it has n't been growing like it did in the period from the 1940s to 1973, or in the period from 1995 to 2005. Productivity is going at a fairly slow rate, and consequently, I think real wages are growing [ at ] a slow rate,.
17293 17293 If the allegations that this businessman is linked to fraud in China, and that there are some people in China who are very unhappy with him, then he should 've known about that,.
17294 17294 This is a worldwide supply and demand shock. It would take a miracle to avoid recession,.
17296 17296 ` Manufacturers, energy producers and small companies have been shedding jobs. Unemployment is low, but will begin to rise if job growth slows much further,.
17297 17297 Most significantly, they would raise businesses' cost of capital, reduce investment and thus weigh on productivity and overall economic growth.
17304 17304 Here, scientifically, I think we need to operate on that credo,.
17309 17309 That 's a healthy development for potential home buyers. Southern cities should once again do better than most other markets.
17311 17311 Some aspects that underpin the rebound may not materialize, and worse global growth outcomes are possible -- for example, a deeper contraction in 2020 and a shallower recovery in 2021 -- depending on the pathway of the pandemic and the severity of the associated economic and financial consequences,.
17313 17313 The cumulative loss to global GDP over 2020 and 2021 from the pandemic crisis could be around $ 9 trillion, greater than the economies of Japan and Germany combined,.
17315 17315 The Home Minister should decide on Shaheen Bagh protests.
17317 17317 The only way you can take away someone 's citizenship is if you have voluntarily acquired citizenship of another country .... Why not Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi will lose their ( Indian ) citizenship ?.
17318 17318 Majority professors there are socialists. Those who are not socialists have been stopped. After several such instances, the situation can not be amended. A big step must be taken by closing it down for two years. Good students in JNU should be accommodated in Delhi University and Ambedkar University, among others which are nearby. The remaining must be dismissed and after necessary clean-up, it can be opened again,.
17319 17319 This includes providing critical services to the real economy and ensuring that the banking system remains financially and operationally resilient. The measures endorsed by GHOS today aim to prioritise these objectives and we remain ready to act further if necessary.
17330 17330 absolutely must travel to mainland China or Hong Kong.
17332 17332 I saw empty shelves for ketchup, mayonnaise, jello. These types of products typically would n't run low this time of year,.
17335 17335 We have low inflation. We 've got lots of employment. If we keep rates low because inflation is not high ... what kind of financial vulnerabilities might you build and how much does that increase the downside tail risk four quarters out, eight quarters out ?.
17342 17342 I will not go into details about our intelligence but what I can say is we have no reason to not believe the reports we have seen from different NATO-allied capitals,.
17343 17343 It does not matter if a country is a NATO member since 1949 or for two weeks. North Macedonia received assistance from Turkey, the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Hungary, Norway and the U.S .. This is not only good for North Macedonia ; it is also good for the whole alliance. The virus does not recognize any border. Therefore, we should fight together against this threat.
17356 17356 What is more likely is sustained proxy attacks against U.S. interests and allies regionally and even globally. Iran has a long history of such attacks in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America, with mixed success,.
17359 17359 We considered starting in the US but it 's currently very hard to film there. Mexico City was a much more alien starting point than London. We can all vaguely imagine how to get out of London but I challenge anyone to get out of Mexico with limited funds.
17360 17360 We 're executing our preferred strategy of not making panicky changes to our process that would have ( note the tense ) alleviated recent pain,.
17361 17361 When the threat of the coronavirus is over, we can just get the economy back online really quickly,.
17363 17363 In our business you have to have a pretty thick skin, but this is probably about as tough as it gets,.
17364 17364 For example, since the proposed rule would systematically exclude studies that do not meet EPA 's criteria for independent validation, critical studies that would otherwise inform influential scientific information will not be used or incorporated into key documents,.
17365 17365 irrespective of where you live or where the accident happened,.
17369 17369 We will probably see a reduction [ in GDP ] in the first quarter, then in the second a recession. It is possible it will carry on, unless the reduction in demand is reversed very substantially in the summer, if some of the restrictions are taken away,.
17372 17372 These measures will work in combination to ease pressure on Canadian borrowers. As containment restrictions are eased and economic activity resumes, fiscal and monetary policy actions will help underpin confidence and stimulate spending by consumers and businesses to restore growth. The Bank 's Governing Council stands ready to adjust the scale or duration of its programs if necessary.
17383 17383 Why would anyone invest in Canada now ?.
17385 17385 If bosses disregard employees' well-being then Government should take tougher action to force compliance.
17386 17386 If companies continue to flout the rules, they should n't just be held accountable in the court of public opinion, the Government must intervene to make them close their doors.
17390 17390 Problems exist only because other people are not as wise or as caring, or not as imaginative and bold, as the anointed [ i.e. Liberals ] ... Police, prisons, etc. represent only tradeoffs, while creating a society in which crime is prevented from arising in the first place is a solution.
17391 17391 This conception of fairness requires that third parties must wield the power to control outcomes.
17403 17403 Chinese people will probably decide to go to the Olympics around April or May. But if this virus continues, the number of tourists from China to Japan will decrease,.
17405 17405 It 's a global crisis where the value of being big and having institutions that can act is, in itself, positive.
17406 17406 The health systems of advanced economies are also much better equipped to cope. In addition, compared with China, citizens in advanced democracies have more trust in their governments. Negative confidence effects in these democracies should, therefore, be somewhat less severe than in China ( and Iran ). However, a rapid spread in other less advanced regions could add significantly to global risks.
17411 17411 The price of an oil gallon should be at this time probably $ 90 to $ 100 per gallon to truly reflect the actual cost in a true free market capitalist system,.
17412 17412 I am officially raising my target for Bitcoin -- and I first made this prediction when it was $ 1. I said this could go to $ 100,000 -- I 'm raising my official target for the first time in eight years. I 'm raising it to $ 400,000.
17413 17413 Sick people are predictable income streams, like the prisoners are. And it can be used like to collateralize the bond market.
17415 17415 I 'm hoping stories like these can first of all help us get grounded into the realities of how transitions work and how change can happen, understand the resistances to change ... and collectively try to find solutions.
17418 17418 It 's hard to estimate because this is n't over yet, it depends how long it continues for, but so far the economic impact must be fairly significant,.
17427 17427 I think they made the project better,.
17428 17428 If you are a senior citizen living on fixed income payments, you care a lot about what 's happening to prices in the economy. If you 're a creditor of someone who 's borrowing or if you 're a borrower, you care about what the Fed is doing. [ The Fed ] directly influences the decisions you make.
17438 17438 We should not just concentrate on Greta. She 's certainly got some kind of celebrity status. But I 'm thinking of the young girl who we have here who has changed at the age of 19 the whole policy of Indonesia concerning plastics.
17444 17444 Would such an approach save as many lives as a complete shutdown ? Possibly not. However, if it could achieve two-thirds of the health objectives at one-third the costs, it would be reckless not to choose it.
17446 17446 Count to 10 and ask yourself whether this is really the best thing to amplify. Whether fighting a virus or a viral scare story, each of us needs to erect small barriers to slow the contagion. Alone, those barriers may seem trivial. Collectively, they work.
17448 17448 It 's one thing for the Home Office to check facts. But it would be completely unacceptable for the Home Office to try to water down the review 's conclusions and judgments about what went wrong.
17449 17449 We ca n't ask people to internalize health risks on an individual basis any more than we can expect polluting factories to self-regulate,.
17451 17451 When you put your signature on paper, there is a mental reflex which means that people, if they already had a tendency to respect the rules, want to respect the commitment made.
17453 17453 For example, a new financial crisis caused by green swan events severely affecting the financial health of the banking and insurance sectors could force central banks to intervene and buy a large set of carbon-intensive assets and/or assets stricken by physical impacts.
17455 17455 It would surprise me -- unless we see this thing get really big, which we ca n't rule out -- that we 'd see some sort of directive from the federal government that schools should be closed.
17456 17456 I do n't think he 's going to have any interest in reining in Wall Street.
17457 17457 If major corporations can be effectively run by CEOs getting one tenth the going rate, it would set a valuable precedent,.
17460 17460 That price discount is too small to give customers a reason to change their behavior, which means the rate transition will not impact peak demand, accelerate renewables or deliver customer savings.
17461 17461 This is truly cataclysmic. If companies ca n't refinance their debts they trade insolvent and it 's all over.
17469 17469 The behaviors that spawned the climate crisis are perhaps even more contagious than smoking,.
17479 17479 The Spring Meetings certainly fit the bill, and we can expect to hear soon that they will be cancelled this year or confined to virtual conferences. Such a move would be welcome, and the Staff Association supports senior management 's cautionary stance in the face of the global health crisis,.
17486 17486 What is distinctive about the research is that we will have access to real-time data by industry and state that will help inform policymakers at every level about the key steps that must be taken to ensure the future viability of small businesses and their employees,.
17491 17491 There is a coronavirus outbreak in the US, the European Union, also in India. In India also, the growth rate would be affected. Jobs ( growth ) will also be affected,.
17492 17492 We need to review many welfare schemes we have put in place supposedly to help the poor, but which do n't have the effect that they should,.
17501 17501 We should definitely make every possible measure to keep people in their jobs,.
17506 17506 if that advice can be given not in the supercilious tone of the Washington consensus but with genuineness, that can be immensely helpful.
17522 17522 Yes, I like that, you should do that.
17524 17524 Good economic policy starts by ensuring that the humans in the economy stay well -- and alive -- so they can participate in the economy as both producers and consumers,.
17529 17529 Cutting production, 1.5 million barrels a day in April or May, is not really going to save you in the current environment,.
17532 17532 This could lead to mass closures of small farms in an industry that is already struggling,.
17534 17534 We are just scratching our heads. Of all the ways you can fund a complex system, cost-based systems are the cheapest way to go. Just implementation of a major payment program could take years,.
17538 17538 The German economy seems unaffected by developments surrounding the coronavirus,.
17546 17546 You can see the computer age everywhere but in the [ labour ] productivity statistics.
17548 17548 There are other scenarios that one could have chosen.
17549 17549 bigger effects can not be ruled out,.
17550 17550 Or his email, that would be kind of weird, and show his picture and then tell everybody, ` Hey, look at all of his activities, look at his relationships,' and then maybe express your feelings towards him directly of any kind, and do it for the rest of your life. I could do that, and I just do n't know if that 's proper.
17552 17552 The government has got to make sure the next round of stimulus does impact the economic activity and almost immediately if they can humanly do it,.
17555 17555 If our farmers go out of business, there is no one to feed us,.
17558 17558 We all have our own personalities, and I do n't think that should be a huge thing about what 's going on right now,.
17563 17563 You know, if J'Lo or Snoop Dog wants to buy them ... hey, call me.
17566 17566 I would encourage a statement, because it 's in the interests of everyone,.
17567 17567 If you 're pharma, this is bad,.
17568 17568 It would be better if we can purchase the medical goods from G2G process. We had also approached both our neighboring countries for the supply of medical kits before as well but they appeared reluctant as they were already coping with the virus outbreak,.
17569 17569 Overall, the risks to the global economy remain on the downside, despite positive news on trade and diminishing concerns of a no-deal Brexit. New trade tensions could emerge between the United States and the European Union, and US-China trade tensions could return. Such events alongside rising geopolitical risks and intensifying social unrest could reverse easy financing conditions, expose financial vulnerabilities, and severely disrupt growth,.
17570 17570 It is very likely that this year the global economy will experience its worst recession since the Great Depression,.
17575 17575 Most major issue to address is the weakness in credit growth. There need to be policies that can resuscitate credit growth but at the same time do n't create further NPA problems, that is the first step. There needs to be a quicker recapitalisation of banks,.
17578 17578 Prime Minister Narendra Modi can answer this question. I am in favour ( of this ). Lord Ganesha removes obstacles. I rather say that a picture of Goddess Lakshmi ( on currency notes ) may improve the condition of Indian currency. Nobody should feel bad about this.
17580 17580 You want 10 per cent growth rate, then investment rate to the GDP should be 37 per cent and 3.7 per cent should be your efficiency factor and not five per cent as it is today,.
17581 17581 The measures that can be taken are ... first Income Tax needs to be abolished. The tax terrorism in our country needs to be reined in so that people start investing and do not fear taxman,.
17583 17583 To reassure investors, the government could express its commitment to return to fiscal rectitude, backing up its intent by accepting the setting up of an independent fiscal council and medium term debt target as suggested by NK Singh Committee,.
17587 17587 If the coronavirus is contained relatively soon then China goes back to normal and Australia accumulates some inventories, but they send those inventories to China in April,.
17588 17588 A region that 's been growing at steady 6 per cent overall could see, even in our baseline scenario, as much as 4 percentage points cut off the growth rate,.
17590 17590 At the end of the day, if we focus on the fundamental point that every child deserves true access to maximizing his or her potential, we will make the right choices,.
17597 17597 If I were the commissioner, I would first of all call the attention of the four countries to the principles about who is responsible for what in Europe.
17598 17598 just because monetary policy can become more expansionary.
17602 17602 I think it points to the reality of the diet itself, it 's not an easy diet to follow,.
17603 17603 To be honest it is considered a very obscure industry ... nothing is negotiated in public, compared to beef or pork for example,.
17605 17605 You may find apps at some point only offering Indian cuisine and have a list of different restaurants.
17607 17607 We know what to do and it is there in our manifesto as well. If the Prime Minister asks us, we will certainly share with him.
17608 17608 With this V-C the campus can not return to normalcy and the government should force him to resign,.
17614 17614 Taking away those requirements would prohibit agencies from considering the impact to air quality -- or water quality -- from a proposed project,.
17617 17617 My office ´ s review of the draft final rule indicates that it utterly fails to provide any demonstrable safety, environmental or economic benefit to consumers or the country,.
17620 17620 If it were solely an environmental agreement, I could not vote for it,.
17621 17621 And I think there 's actually some wisdom in that.
17622 17622 Technology has come a long way in finding things that can affect viruses, so we have some hope that science 's response will shorten the full life cycle of this crisis,.
17624 17624 Our focus is not on whether there is a race problem in economics,.
17625 17625 If not, they 'll have a buffer that will be needed to support the credit needs of the economy.
17628 17628 For the economy to recover, investment must revive, which is why the government recently announced a major infrastructure initiative,.
17632 17632 We referred [ to the FCA ] the incident and the parties involved in the incident which would include not just the technical party related to the audio link but the parties who used the information,.
17636 17636 if the world is slower than the UK, a very open economy, it will have an impact.
17638 17638 If you 're not at the table to set the rules, it 's unlikely that those rules are going to be exactly what you think they should be,.
17639 17639 Given the scale of the climate challenge and the rising expectations of our citizens, 2020 must be a year of climate action where everybody 's in, and that includes the world 's leading financial center,.
17640 17640 There is more room for easing expectations to rise should incoming data disappoint and that could keep short-term sterling downside risks intact,.
17643 17643 Start doing some landscaping and all of those things you can start to do to make sure you are ready, because as soon as we start flattening that curve, things are going to explode again.
17645 17645 Hence, we may see greater demand from wealthy Chinese households.
17646 17646 I do n't know which force will be greater : the negative impact of job cuts, if that was to occur, or the positive influence of low mortgage rates,.
17649 17649 While the uncertainty is substantial, we expect the lockdowns and social distancing to result in sharply lower new infections over the next month, and our baseline is that slower virus spread and adaptation by businesses and individuals should set the stage for a gradual recovery in output starting in May/June.
17656 17656 We will discuss our response to the whole range of Russian missile systems -- conventional and nuclear -- currently deployed or under development.
17660 17660 You are right that this crisis is special because normally when we have natural disaster it is one or two allies directly affected and all the others can come to provide to the one ally affected,.
17668 17668 I really wanted to do right by him and that character and I knew the only way this joke was really going to work is if I was massive. Because the bigger he was or the more capable of being a beast in the field he was, the funnier it was that he was in the van,.
17669 17669 Obviously, the hope is that people fall in love with this world and that they want to see more of it, but I do n't think that there 's any world where we ever do a film and Will and Martin are n't some way a part of it. It 's been a huge honor for both of us.
17670 17670 In principle, global value chains make it easier to engage in import or export activities because the manufacturing of parts does not require the full range of capabilities of producing a finished product,.
17682 17682 We would see shrinkage of this negative impact, but not the eradication of this impact.
17696 17696 that it can represent a source of inspiration for other countries.
17700 17700 The financial sector can play a crucial role in moving the world to net zero carbon emissions and reach the targets of the Paris Agreement,.
17701 17701 They may have children from a series of relationships, some or none of whom they know and some of whom are living with other men. Such fractured and fragile relationships bring little daily joy or comfort and do little to assure middle-aged men that they are living a good life,.
17708 17708 I think the sharemarket as a benchmark is down 15, 16 per cent in a few weeks, and that 's a lot of money on your super or your direct holdings or your shares. And if unemployment goes up, regardless of interest rates, you 're going to get a problem.
17710 17710 We would strongly urge you to lay before both Houses Magnitsky legislation which addresses this issue, in order to prevent the UK from becoming a magnet for individuals engaged in corruption.
17720 17720 would 've brought any economy, weak or strong, to its knees,.
17722 17722 If you can keep people on for when your demand for your goods and services ramps back up, then you do n't have to go through hiring and retraining,.
17724 17724 We have n't made the investments that we would need to be agile and effective enough to absorb what we 're seeing.
17726 17726 He modernized Saskatchewan from being a very rural province. I can remember my mom talking about growing up in southern Saskatchewan, it was an outhouse, no electricity it was a typical pioneer living. Tommy helped get the electricity in, paved the roads,.
17731 17731 I 've been riding motorcycles since I was eight years old, and just love them I suppose,.
17732 17732 a health issue rather than a transport or sport or any other issue, but we will take whatever step is necessary.
17734 17734 As corporate parents I would not be happy with our own children being out of education, employment and training.
17738 17738 We 're very comfortable with Tom and his leadership and the support of Marty and the organization. We think we 'll do what we need to do at the trade deadline to improve the team.
17742 17742 But in the current crisis ... whether or not Europeans help each other fast in this acute emergency can shape popular perceptions of what Europe stands for -- and for a long time to come.
17744 17744 It is a good time to reflect again on how we have performed for you as a risk mitigation strategy, if for no other reason than to give you some reassurance and even solace following one of the scariest months for markets on record,.
17745 17745 If the pandemic does n't pop this bubble then, of course, it will be something else that eventually accomplishes this,.
17749 17749 A short stay really does go a long way so if you can have a night or two in country Victoria it will be enormously appreciated -- and you 'll have a ball.
17750 17750 We basically had two weeks of incredible images being broadcast around the world. We 've actually seen the largest attendance in Australian history, so whilst those fires would not have been helpful for a period of time ... those who have been paying attention would have seen that Melbourne and many, many parts of Victoria are absolutely open for business.
17751 17751 Any question that 's couched in terms of ` is it possible ?' I would say, right now, pretty much anything 's possible.
17753 17753 Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) is still work in progress. GST was supposed to be revenue neutral. But the government has lost revenue post-GST implementation, which is not tenable,.
17754 17754 I think we 're just starting to see this emerge into the phenomena that it 's going to become. So I think this is a huge area. I can tell you the students who are focusing on these areas are not having a problem finding jobs here in Los Angeles and in other places,.
17755 17755 If you take the most likely scenario and the CDC is roughly right, then it 's pretty hard to avoid one.
17759 17759 Not confident at all. Recession is more than likely.
17761 17761 The first quarter was probably down 4 or 5 % I think. A lot really depends on what you 're assuming for the timing of the lock down and what a lockdown means in terms of output.
17766 17766 It 's reasonable to assume that those effects will manifest in the data in about 2 or 3 months,.
17767 17767 Should Place-Based Jobs Policies Be Used to Help Distressed Communities ?.
17768 17768 The data we have so far suggest that the drop in aggregate spending already taking place will be extremely large,.
17769 17769 When I go to American cities people go crazy on me and say : ` Please bring it here, can we please have it here ?'.
17770 17770 As leaders in education, research, medicine, and service, our actions affect the lives of Iowans and people all over the world. We must break down barriers, challenge preconceptions, and commit to working together with welcoming arms and open minds. Our ability to foster equity and inclusion will determine our collective success.
17772 17772 I 'm therefore keeping my forecast that BI cuts again by another 25 basis points in the second quarter as growth disappoints, and we 're still not seeing clear indications of more fiscal support.
17773 17773 If Covid is prolonged by 3-6 months, and if there is lockdown and if international trade falls by 30 %, and also international flights are affected, the scenario can be more severe,.
17786 17786 Since we live in an interconnected world, we can not ignore this shift in world interest rates.
17787 17787 We have made it very clear to the banking industry that we expect them to develop the functionality to allow the merchant to choose which payment rails it goes through, the international schemes or the EFTPOS schemes,.
17791 17791 It might get worse ... Under more severely strained circumstances, we will have to rethink our playbook substantially. Some banking systems might have to be recapitalized or even restructured,.
17792 17792 It ( the plan to abolish the reservation ) has created an environment of insecurity among all minorities as well as among the Christian community. We need to make inroads .... I think we need to ( take up ) constructive measures, find ways of taking this up in the community as well as in the larger Christian community. Make representations so that something can be done in this direction,.
17794 17794 It would n't be a bad deal to get an extra week off at Christmas time,.
17795 17795 It would creep up through the generations -- it would n't bite you in the seat of the pants,.
17798 17798 So if this were going to last just that long, $ US1 trillion might be enough,.
17805 17805 A broad interpretation of our monetary policy mandate would ultimately jeopardize independence, and quite rightly in my view,.
17806 17806 There are instruments available, fiscal policy instruments or social policy instruments for such cases, like short term allowances, that we have used in the past and that have proved quite effective,.
17807 17807 I would say that there is a lot of movement going on. I 'm very optimistic that we will get a carbon tax very soon,.
17809 17809 Of course I would be happy to assist the parliamentary committee in any way I can if asked to give evidence.
17811 17811 We are regaining our strength. I have even started to run again, although quite slowly and about half my usual distance. I am careful to run routes where I am unlikely to encounter others, and I have a mask I can pull up if I do.
17815 17815 But wearing a mask all the time will be ineffective because it will allow viruses to be transmitted around it, through it and worse still if it becomes moist it will encourage the growth of viruses and bacteria.
17816 17816 You can have anywhere from 25 to 100 pages of information in ( title documents ),.
17819 17819 If the council says that they support this initiative and they want to make sure that the lives of working people are eased during this crisis, I would urge no delays in having the urgent committee meetings we will need to discuss this legislation and to pass this bill without any delays and without any watering down,.
17820 17820 This is huge and I think we should be proud of our movement,.
17823 17823 in order to attract strategic investors to the market who can have a positive impact by, for example, investing in the infrastructure of a club.
17824 17824 It 's true sometimes, you could even argue that it 's true often, but it 's not always true -- and if you 're not careful, you can end up in a situation where it 's not true anymore, and that 's exactly where we are today,.
17826 17826 Broadly speaking, over the last 20 years in the US, we see profits of incumbents becoming more persistent, because they are less challenged, their market share has become both larger and more stable, and at the same time, we see a lot of lobbying by incumbents, in particular to get their mergers approved or to protect their rents,.
17828 17828 The crisis will also cause massive upheaval on the job market. This could put the situation at the high point of the financial crisis into the shadows.
17829 17829 The median age in a lot of countries is 20 or 18, much younger than in Europe, and it appears that young people who are infected are often asymptomatic or just get a cold.
17830 17830 We assume that students prefer remote learning. I am personally running three separate experiments with several hundred participants on whether that is true. It is not true.
17831 17831 Who is a citizen, who is not, who can be allowed to enter, who is barred ? Would families be allowed to live together in detention camps ? Would children be separated from parents ? The government wants us to worry over our future with such questions, without creating any solution for the problems the Assam NRC has caused,.
17835 17835 makes a lot of Iranians scared of where the future is headed, and I do n't think that 's good for the regime.
17836 17836 There should be lots of consultation with Iraqi politicians about just how heavy the price will be if more Americans are killed.
17837 17837 There is a point in time where they see prices are flattening out and prices are going down ... so flippers stop buying, or some percentage of them.
17838 17838 Today the 19th March 2020, is the most important day in the history of this country : we are starting a real change from today following the journey we started after the constitutional court ruling on the May 2019 presidential election that nullified the elections on 3rd February 2020,.
17839 17839 I will be honest with you. You do things for fun [ the posts on Facebook and other social media platforms ], but they are people who take such things seriously to the extent that they can eliminate you ... some do n't even write the posts, they simply for what others are posting and report to their bosses ... I am telling you : people lose jobs, people get fired from cabinet positions with such mere posts.
17840 17840 We want a nation in which everyone should be happy,.
17846 17846 industries grew up around the sugar [ industry ], and those industries persisted. And once you have this manufacturing environment, that can lead to other changes : More infrastructure and more schools have persisted in these areas as well.
17847 17847 It is not a healthy scenario at all. What we have is probably two quarters of oil prices in the $ 40 range. It 's quite possible ... if indeed it 's a price war, you could see it sub - $ 40,.
17849 17849 a recession may result in near-zero interest rates at long maturities, bringing U.S. experience closer to that seen in Europe and Japan.
17852 17852 If they 're building a plant with a capacity of 3 million tons a year, that 's presumably because they expect to be able to produce that,.
17853 17853 sustained, substantial and likely to continue.
17854 17854 sends a strong message to comparison websites and search engines that if ranking or ordering of results is based or influenced by advertising, they should be upfront and clear with consumers about this so that consumers are not misled.
17856 17856 There is, of course, a cost to consider as white, male doctors and lawyers and other professionals are replaced by, or competing with, other people,.
17861 17861 The OAS needs to explain why it made these statements and why anyone should trust it when it comes to elections.
17863 17863 A key question is whether Modi is willing to use some of his political capital to push through the privatisation and related reforms.
17866 17866 So if Greta comes this year, she will see that we have made substantial progress,.
17868 17868 We try -- and I think quite successfully -- to integrate the bottom-up, young generation very much.
17869 17869 Some people ... say :' I am willing to take the risk of a very low interest rate now', and others say the problem with that is, if you do end up with a financial stability problem, the very people you are trying to help are going to be the ones that are hurt worse ... That is kind of the issue. It may be about a time-frame question.
17870 17870 tainted though it may be.
17873 17873 I think we need to open up again in some method, due to the fact that otherwise the security damages is going to be amazing,.
17874 17874 Roads to Prosperity or Bridges to Nowhere ? Theory and Evidence on the Impact of Public Infrastructure Investment.
17875 17875 The question that the show poses is -- if you hunt monsters, do you risk becoming a monster yourself ?.
17877 17877 There 's this great world-weariness about him so few young actors can achieve,.
17878 17878 He keep the accent off-camera, he devotes all of his time and being to ensuring the authenticity of this person and exploring depths and dimensions about him that we could n't even imagine.
17882 17882 Job growth clearly has slowed from its peak, but the sharp downturn in most of the forward-looking surveys -- pointing to payroll growth of just 50,000 or so -- has not been fully captured in the data,.
17883 17883 Italy yesterday reported a 6.9 % increase in cases, the best day since the crisis began, lifting the doubling rate to 10.4 days. Further progress is likely over the next week, given the paths seen in China and Korea.
17888 17888 Removing regulatory barriers along with obstacles to access to finance and markets can give women-led businesses the opportunity to succeed,.
17894 17894 I think that if this continues for another month or so, then most people will be somehow affected by this.
17896 17896 You can say ` Oh, we 're doing goal-based savings because we can find out what people are saving for and then we can market to them in a better way,'.
17898 17898 We will adopt a looser monetary policy if necessary. We still have room to do so. However, we will not let the interest rate becomes negative or zero.
17899 17899 But this is not the case for everybody, and there is a part of society, and not a small one, that prefers or is constrained to use cash.
17900 17900 Democracy is able to solve problems because citizen can rationalise issues and find an optimal solution. In Nigeria that is unlikely to take place because, a terrible thing has happened to us. Whereby any view that contravenes the policy of the government in power is condemned.
17902 17902 obsession with targets, outcomes and making people do things in a way where you can tick things off, has been very harmful.
17904 17904 What 's the point of discussing deals if u do n't know what you 're trading ?.
17906 17906 This would be the proper occasion to introduce eurobonds, directly connected to the coronavirus crisis,.
17909 17909 Anything that slows the rate of the virus is the best thing you can do for the economy, even if by conventional measures it 's bad for the economy.
17911 17911 It 's done exactly what we said it would, and we 're excited for more investors to discover it now that it 's been approved for trading on these three new platforms.
17914 17914 That 's where you can get the bigger impacts on the economy.
17918 17918 We may need to do even more if necessary, and do it again and again until we all see the light at the end of the tunnel,.
17920 17920 We have n't seen that yet from China but I think they will be forced to do that.
17926 17926 The Financial Secrecy Index is like the Hubble telescope of tracking harmful regulations around the planet and mapping out a trajectory towards a more transparent world but while countries around the world are making progress towards financial transparency the US seems to be digging its heels in secrecy.
17930 17930 A transition issue talks about political leadership, and it talks about national leadership, the economy, well-being of the people and what not ... it is not the leadership of a Parent-Teacher Association, it is the national leadership and it should be handled with care and decorum,.
17932 17932 It 's a simple reality of humanity that we all need private spaces where we are not observed, where we can be at peace, where we can be our true selves without fear of being exposed or being exploited.
17933 17933 Policies imposed in rich countries to fight the coronavirus could have adverse effects in low-income nations -- potentially endangering more lives than they save.
17936 17936 We will see whether or not shale will be killed ... which I do n't think so,.
17937 17937 We need to accept that we can not stop the coming wave of technological change. But we can moderate its impact on society. We should act with purpose, embracing AI as a tool that will enable us to create a better and fairer world.
17939 17939 I started playing football in 2006 and the journey has never been easy at all because in Africa when you want to start playing football it is never easy as is the case may be in Europe,.
17942 17942 There is no local conflict in-country or warring neighbours, with ease of access, good medical facilities, a lack of corruption, security of tenure, the ability to repatriate earnings without much hassle and a reasonably stable government, compared with some African countries,.
17945 17945 And we also expect a responsible and sensible approach to how these rules should be applied. That is, they would not apply, for example, to gambling branding on basketball players' uniforms.
17946 17946 From the evidence we 've received it 's clear that many businesses are still not doing the right thing. This must change now. This is a health emergency-it can not be business as usual.
17951 17951 It seems that we 're there now and we need to escape very quickly,.
17953 17953 I think it 's disappointing that this is the case but however he made his decision and he has to carry through with that.
17954 17954 Depending on the pressures in the system in the months ahead, trusts ( which provide health services ) may have to consider postponing routine elective appointments and surgeries to focus on the immediate demands associated with coronavirus.
17956 17956 I could be crude and say get off your arse. I can not believe they have squandered all those opportunities to lead on this debate for the last 30 years,.
17957 17957 If @ MikeBloomberg wants any hope of winning the Democratic nomination, he really needs to step up his # DemDebate game. He was a C + tonight at his best moments. He does n't know his audience ... He came in overconfident and underprepared.
17958 17958 The fact that we have the strongest economy in 50 years and he 's stuck at 43 % approval ought to scream volumes for his language and his overreach,.
17960 17960 Well, if the Fed 's already cutting rates and doing QE, and we 're not getting much results, think how much we 'd have to do in order to hit the target.
17963 17963 Entertainment, hospitality, food and lodging, service jobs -- they wo n't lose their jobs but will probably get a cut in hours,.
17964 17964 should fully pack their belongings for reassignment to a new residence.
17965 17965 So you 're not winning, to me, you have to assess everything. I think anybody would want to do that. And probably in the next month or so, we 're going to get together as an organization and just discuss things.
17967 17967 they want or expect ; they fail to recognize the pent-up forces they are unleashing or the larger historical significance of the decisions they are taking.
17974 17974 I think Creighton is another team. People have seen what they 've done the last couple of weeks.
17975 17975 Just think of the following, Foreign Direct Investment to Africa rose by 11 per cent in 2019, compared to just four per cent in Asia, while it declined by -13 per cent globally and by -23 per cent for developed economies.
17977 17977 Fostering more inclusive growth would also require building Africa 's human capital and creating more jobs in high-productivity sectors,.
17978 17978 Sierra Leone should not be spending over $ 200 million yearly importing rice because its climatic conditions are generally favorable for rice production.
17980 17980 This is one of the functions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and I think historically they have done a really good job with that. We need to recognize and support the importance of the CDC for being able to serve its function that will be very important going forward.
17982 17982 It is as if financial instruments such as insurance do not exist,.
17986 17986 toxic politics and constrained central banks could make the next downturn hard to escape.
17987 17987 treat folks as human beings, to look at the whole body of evidence, [ and ] to not be afraid to re-open a case if there 's bias in the system.
17988 17988 We had the case of the SARS virus several years ago, and Ebola virus recently. We are pulling some of these experiences together quickly for the Chinese government to see if there is any lesson that they will find useful,.
17990 17990 I would also like to take the opportunity of thanking both Vinita and Virginia for their outstanding service to the Company. We look forward to their continuing contribution to the work of the Board over the coming months.
17991 17991 In there, we had a huge control room, which at any time would have between 20 and 30 producers and camera ops working, recording, logging everything that was going on, and also studying the game,.
17993 17993 I fear that the Trump Administration has been trying to make China seem like the US' enemy,.
17998 17998 You might be looking at 15 % unemployment for a long time,.
18000 18000 The most likely scenario is a V-shaped curve, which means a decline in economic activities followed by a rapid recovery, with the total economic impact relatively contained,.
18004 18004 For a year, you can run a budget deficit of $ US2 trillion to $ US3 trillion dollars,.
18005 18005 It is true that a country like India might be sheltered compared to a larger open economy like China or some of the smaller open economies in Asia and other parts of the world when there is a major global shock, but India needs opening up because that is going to be beneficial for potential growth,.
18009 18009 You have dentist 's offices and restaurants saying, ` everyone go home, you 're unemployed.' If the coronavirus goes on for months, some of these businesses will not survive and you will get a U-shaped recovery,.
18010 18010 a ` Public-Private-Farmer Group Partnership' model could be the way ahead for pushing agri exports from India,.
18011 18011 Having said that let me also say the challenges facing the continent are quite significant -- whether it 's in youth unemployment, in terms of climate change and in terms of the pandemic that we are facing today -- coronavirus ( COVID-19 ), low intensity conflicts, terrorism and insecurity,.
18012 18012 I 'd expect we 'll see the real hit come a few quarters from now, when companies that would have been on the verge of buying in the next few months slow their buying decisions.
18014 18014 Under the Withdrawal Agreement there would need to be checks at the border between Great Britain and Ireland. The extent of these checks is as yet to be determined, but, even using technological solutions, business will incur new costs and increased border infrastructure in Welsh ports will be required.
18022 18022 people do n't feel like they are exposed to disproportionate risk ... there is a good chance that we might see a very strong boost ... If the answer is no, then things could get a bit rocky.
18032 18032 The prophets of doom who thought that more debt was more risk have generally been wrong for the last 12 years,.
18035 18035 Everything depends on how rapidly it spreads and how serious it gets, but in principle, this could have a serious impact on consumption,.
18037 18037 You can be infected over and over, and we really do n't know for this novel coronavirus if that 's also true,.
18041 18041 The ACCC can not control the petrol prices companies set, but we can call out problematic price setting which can influence company behaviour.
18044 18044 But given the state of the financial vulnerabilities in Canada, we judged the risk of reignited an acceleration in house price expectations and a buildup of debt was too high -- and that could make attaining our inflation target harder in the long run.
18045 18045 Given the weakness in the global economy, we could have considered a cut to ensure the Canadian economy would n't perform below its potential and pull inflation below target,.
18049 18049 In addition to this sectoral effects, worsening consumer and business sentiment can lead to firms to expect lower demand and reduce their spending and investment. In turn, this would exacerbate business closures and job losses.
18050 18050 The economic landscape will be altered significantly for the duration of the crisis and possibly longer, with greater involvement of government and central banks in the economy.
18052 18052 something that countries ca n't actually argue about. It is a major issue. They have to step up and they should display all the political will that 's needed to get the job done.
18057 18057 I will only make a recommendation to change the way we do things if we can replicate the richness of the census data,.
18062 18062 But under any scenario, including if the president is removed, the impact on markets will be short-lived,.
18064 18064 If we have a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 4 % or below, we should have a solid market,.
18066 18066 I think the economy is President Trump 's friend, but it is not his best friend,.
18081 18081 To avoid permanent damage from the virus-induced downturn, it is important to ensure that credit is available for otherwise sound borrowers who face a temporary period of low income or revenues,.
18082 18082 I think a V is possible, but I am worried that the outcome could be worse,.
18083 18083 A ` V,' which is what we 're all hoping for, is really a best-case scenario and if activity could begin to resume as many assume in June and maybe be back to something more normal by the summer I think a ` V' is possible,.
18089 18089 are indeed high, as few Republican senators are likely to risk incurring Trump 's displeasure at a time when he 's feeling both triumphant and vindictive,.
18093 18093 He 'd rather win the argument than be right. Though the two may be confused in his mind.
18094 18094 certain evidence I would have liked to have seen led in this trial.
18097 18097 I think some people were intimidated but ( Woman B ) was not one of those people.
18098 18098 It was n't getting through, he thought it was funny, he was trying to make banter of it.
18100 18100 I never thought that a customer care team can work from home. It is because of the cloud telephony that we are able to service each customer in spite of the lockdown. In most tech companies, engineering teams are still working and productive. Coordination and execution would n't be possible without the adoption of products like Zoom, Slack etc.
18101 18101 Democrats would target poor people and the Republicans would target rich people. Democrats would target small business tax cuts and Republicans would target big corporations and capital gains taxes,.
18102 18102 It is an astounding book and every organisation or individual ought to administer its erudition. The basic principle is, ` If something ca n't be measured then, it ca n't be improved. Measure everything that you want to grow',.
18110 18110 They can only access those coupons once a month to buy those goods so they can be in these cantonments or outside, it does n't matter,.
18113 18113 Turkey should produce. Turkey should produce in factories, plants and universities. [ Central Anatolian province of ] Yozgat has plentiful lentil, we have to stop importing lentils,.
18116 18116 I am not a bigot like you. My daughter has, after age 21, the right to her views subject to Constitutional restrictions. Do n't follow her tweets if you can stand it.
18117 18117 We can not sell our family silver,.
18123 18123 I would be supportive of the Fed really doing the hard work to assess whether that 's needed going forward,.
18125 18125 There are still a lot of risks out there, but if you can identify individual shares with good dividend yields and strong financials, then you can buy at a pretty good price.
18127 18127 However, the action taken by the [ Federal Open Market Committee ] can help support confidence and ease financial conditions of indebted households and firms, thereby helping to mitigate potential demand-side impacts of the virus,.
18131 18131 If these youth got registered, it will assist us to find more votes that will make us to beat 50 +1 votes,.
18134 18134 Upper-income people will probably wait until after the election compared to more middle-class, everyday people just because any changes to a new tax law or new regulations could have a bigger impact for them.
18136 18136 Moreover, the latest stock market correction could provide exceptional, even lower mortgage rates for a few weeks, and that would help bring about a noticeable upturn in the coming months.
18137 18137 The demand for U.S. real estate may actually rise from wealthy Chinese because they 're getting tired of this type of situation where Third World-type market behavior crops up,.
18138 18138 Consequently, people 's rents and home prices are rising faster than income growth, and have been for years. This issue should be at the forefront of election debates.
18140 18140 If home values are very high, that also means that trying to recruit people at the same wage will be difficult,.
18141 18141 We are in uncertain times, but I do think that people who are staying at home right now, once the all-clear signal is given, will be going back into the market,.
18143 18143 We must invest not only in AI, but in human intelligence as well.
18146 18146 If the number of visitors decreases rather than increases, the hit to Japan 's consumer industry will be quite large,.
18148 18148 We may be closing our stores for business as usual, but will remain open for care, particularly for key workers,.
18149 18149 Now the question is : Can the US and OPEC save this market ? The demand shock has become so large that they ca n't do it alone,.
18151 18151 This will likely be a game-changer for the industry,.
18152 18152 There is no excuse in crime, I also should go to jail if I have committed some crime,.
18153 18153 This would take a lot of concentration and focus, but it is not something that is wholly beyond our capacity.
18155 18155 I ask to further tighten control across all the regions, at border checkpoints, airports and stations both for our citizens and foreigners over the weekend, or the two days off,.
18156 18156 When you look at Health Canada regulations, certifications and approvals are n't necessary at this point, so that 's why you 're likely going to see gene-edited foods in our supply chain without any approvals whatsoever.
18160 18160 Whether they are effective will depend on compliance and the prime minister 's message needs to be reinforced by a daily communication exercise targeting the general public as well as special groups like young people,.
18162 18162 And even if Elisabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders want to reform the global trade system and are more pro-active on topics like workers' rights, their view would hurt China much more than the EU.
18165 18165 climate breakdown could render investments held by millions of people worthless.
18166 18166 For Glasgow that must be well on the path. That that is the norm. That the question does n't even have to be asked because companies are answering that question as part of their strategy,.
18167 18167 The spillover would be containable,.
18168 18168 I would focus on something big and immediate.
18172 18172 The wild card is whether turmoil in the Middle East triggers a sustained sell-off in equities, depressing business and consumer confidence to the point where labor market and inflation concerns become secondary,.
18173 18173 I 'm very sympathetic to that argument. But we are going to need an airline industry in September. So bail them out and sack the C.E.O.s .. You ca n't think in normal terms. This is more like a wartime crisis than a normal economic situation.
18177 18177 These losses were trivial in the bigger picture. For April, we think payrolls will drop by 14-to-17M, driving the unemployment rate to 12-to-14 %.
18181 18181 We do not think this is a shock that can be managed by central banks alone,.
18184 18184 Government gave us 36 months to complete this project, but I can assure you that we would finish it in 15 months. We should be able to finish before the end of next year.
18185 18185 I can also confirm that the patient had travelled back to Wales from Northern Italy, where the virus was contracted.
18188 18188 I can use that term because I am one,.
18190 18190 We hope his replacement continues with this important work. It is deeply concerning to hear of repeated allegations of bullying by the Home Secretary and this should be investigated thoroughly.
18192 18192 It would be an outrage and an insult to the Windrush generation for Wendy Williams' independent Review to be watered down for political reasons.
18194 18194 I think that 's what you are looking for is people who can think for themselves.
18195 18195 if historically low unemployment and strong economic growth are not triggering rampant inflation, then perhaps the Fed should butt out for now.
18199 18199 The current proposal of the 700 MHz frequency auction by the CTU did not allow a truly independent infrastructure operator to be established that could potentially be the fourth operator.
18201 18201 Not having diagnosed the illness of the patient, the doctor is helpless. The least the doctor can do is to say ... I am sorry. We made mistake, will Dr. Manmohan Singh come and advise us,.
18207 18207 We tend to think of impact as a bad thing. But high-impact, weight-bearing exercise is what makes our bones strong,.
18209 18209 A week ago, I thought $ 1,000 per adult, $ 500 per child. Now I 'd double or triple that. Get them the check within three months, or less. And make clear that if the economy is in bad shape at the end of the year we 'll do it again, and keep doing it.
18210 18210 It would enable people to not work, if that 's what they need to do. It will prevent some people from not making their rent payments or other payments,.
18213 18213 We want to signal that we want to work quickly and efficiently and that the good work that we are doing should not be compromised by issues of elections,.
18216 18216 This could pave the way for negotiations among Afghans, sustainable peace, and ensuring the country is never again a safe haven for terrorists.
18221 18221 We will try to do whatever we can to find a way to solve this issue because it 's one of the issues that has created problems inside the alliance. There 's no way to deny that.
18226 18226 Actually we could do more to provide support if that is requested or called for by the EU, for instance, to help implement the arms embargo against Libya,.
18233 18233 I do n't think [ a solution ] is a long way away. I think we 're talking about a very intensive time of negotiations and talks between the four parties in the next few days. I do n't think we 're talking about months or weeks, I think we 're talking about something happening fairly soon and getting a good result in the near future.
18236 18236 We are now, we think, on a pathway to a possible solution to the immediate problems that beset the FAI. We think that the constructive nature of the meeting indicated that all four stakeholders are absolutely united in their determination to do what has to be done for Irish soccer particularly from our point of view for the grassroots,.
18237 18237 In Judaism, it says that if you save one person, you can look at yourself as somebody who has saved the whole world. In that regard, what goodness means is to scale the problem down to the size where we can have an impact -- and then have the impact.
18239 18239 they should be open-eyed about what they are doing.
18244 18244 They do n't have that reassurance they would normally have.
18245 18245 At Shanghai Disney Resort, we currently estimate the closure of the park could have an adverse impact on second quarter operating income of approximately $ 135 million assuming the park is closed for two months during Q2,.
18246 18246 We 'd like to encourage the youth to be active and to provide their help to ( the ) seniors so we can interact with them,.
18247 18247 how the IMF can be of help.
18251 18251 I really hope that all policymakers everywhere would be thinking about.
18253 18253 The IMF is making available about $ 50 billion through its rapid-disbursing emergency financing facilities for low income and emerging market countries that could potentially seek support. Of this, $ 10 billion is available at zero interest for the poorest members through the Rapid Credit Facility.
18255 18255 Now that the U.S. has taken this important step, I am confident that other NAB contributors who have not yet done it will also expedite their commitments, so the IMF can continue to play its essential role as a lender of last resort at this time of crisis.
18264 18264 the best-performing 4 percent of listed companies account for the entire net gain of the US stock market since 1926, with the rest collectively only matching the returns that could have been found in dowdy Treasury bills.
18266 18266 The South African Reserve Bank has lowered the repo rate and this is a hugely welcome move for the property industry. This, coupled with inflation at a lower rate than last year at this time, theoretically means that those currently paying off bonds should make a huge effort to pay the instalments they were previously paying into a bond, and even a little bit more if possible, every month in order to save on interest and shorten the ultimate payback period,.
18273 18273 Without the industry 's input, these technologies may simply not achieve the scale needed for them to move the dial on emissions,.
18274 18274 prepare for the expectation that this ( Covid-19 ) might be bad.
18275 18275 This is the reason I am telling them that we can use the current situation to step up our ambition to tackle climate change.
18277 18277 These issues are big issues -- coronavirus, market conditions -- but these are temporary. Maybe in a few months, maybe longer, the market conditions will recover, but our climate challenge will still be there.
18278 18278 Building on success in the electricity sector, now the government must focus its efforts on achieving stronger emissions reductions in the transport and heating sectors. The IEA welcomes the recently adopted Climate Action Programme 2030, which includes a carbon price in the transport and heating sectors, as an important step in the right direction,.
18279 18279 Large-scale investment to boost the development, deployment and integration of clean energy technologies -- such as solar, wind, hydrogen, batteries and carbon capture ( CCUS ) -- should be a central part of governments' plans because it will bring the twin benefits of stimulating economies and accelerating clean energy transitions,.
18283 18283 He is mediocre at best as a defender at third base. His swing has changed dramatically since 2016, and I question if he is truly 100 % healthy. Sure, he has the ability, and he is a big, strong man, but his offensive impact is nowhere close to what he looked like when the Cubs won the World Series.
18286 18286 So we decided at that point we would divide up the world : Angus went to India and I went to Africa.
18288 18288 The U.S. made clear that they would cut Marshall aid if the Communists were ever allowed back in power,.
18290 18290 we would, at that point, be dealing with zero interest rates.
18296 18296 We believe in political speech, and ads can be an important part of that,.
18297 18297 Tradition can be beautiful. If you want that surprise proposal, I hope you get it. But if you ca n't talk to your boyfriend about marriage, you 're either dating the wrong person or you 're not giving him credit for being the right person.
18299 18299 You never said it would be this hard.
18301 18301 How productive would you be in Haiti ?.
18303 18303 It was a high concept, and we did n't want to confuse people. But there are lots of twists and turns we can now do going forward.
18304 18304 What I really love about the format is the comedy it can give you -- and the comedy comes from people saying one thing publicly and another privately. I 'm a really big fan of stuff that is comedic first and dramatic second,.
18308 18308 Such a program would have to be carefully calibrated to minimize the credit risk taken by the Fed while still providing needed liquidity to an essential market.
18310 18310 how a group of principals who are in an interdependent situation can organize and govern themselves to obtain continuing joint benefits when all face temptations to free-ride, shirk or otherwise act opportunistically.
18311 18311 I think it 's a fair assumption that the longer we are shut down the more challenging the start-up will be,.
18312 18312 If we agree on a reasonable amount, we will take it from there.
18313 18313 immediate isolation of people suspected of being infected with the disease and the corresponding medical control.
18316 18316 the airline industry doing badly adversely affects the catering industry, which in turn, can impact farmers.
18325 18325 At the age of 18, I was diagnosed with oral cancer and given a 15 % chance of living five years. Fortunately, I was able to beat cancer due to radiation therapy. If Marie Curie had not made her discovery, I would not be here today,.
18328 18328 I share that frustration. The string of incidents last fall and this spring have highlighted that we have a long way to go to be the community we need to be. We are a university made up of some wonderfully intelligent, caring individuals, and working together we can do better.
18329 18329 For instance, some international students will not be able to return home at this time. Some students may be unable to access online classes in their home location ; some may need to stay in Madison for other reasons. University Housing will provide additional guidance to students. Residence halls will remain available to these students where necessary, but we expect the majority of dorm residents to return home, leaving the residence halls much emptier and making it easier for remaining students to maintain social distance,.
18330 18330 I think Amazon is going to be fine through this, it 's your local businesses you 've got to worry about,.
18331 18331 Let 's design it well in a way that actually can bring forth carbon pricing.
18333 18333 This could be a pathway to beyond the standard model of physics. The standard model explains only the known fundamental particles plus the Higgs, but not dark matter. We know it 's not a complete theory of the universe, because we know there is dark matter out there, and right here.
18335 18335 At this point I would say the best thing that governments can do is to really fight the epidemic rather than worry about stimulus measures. That comes later,.
18336 18336 Banks, insurers and bond mutual funds should be encouraged to buy new investment-grade bonds.
18339 18339 Fortunately, the COVID-19 mortality rate for young adults appears to be quite low,.
18340 18340 If we want to have a fighting chance, we need it immediately. In the next two to three weeks, if we act really decisively, we may be able to flatten the curve and then when the storm comes it will be not be as brutal as we see in Europe.
18345 18345 set a target to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner.
18347 18347 If women are empowered to transition from informal to formal [ work ] then that will boost GDP growth,.
18350 18350 While many students can handle unexpected costs, this sudden change in housing highlights the large disparity within our student population concerning students' access to disposable wealth and the resources necessary to evacuate and move off-campus,.
18351 18351 As we 've been doing from the beginning, we 're following the advice of public health experts, and in case the circumstances change, of course, we 'll be flexible, but at this point right now we are firmly coming back for a special session at the end of May,.
18352 18352 help guide us to what may be better strategies for cutting waste.
18353 18353 might have been an overreaction,.
18355 18355 This is a time when we must all play our part,.
18360 18360 It will definitely change our practices because there are areas burnt that I will probably never see recovery in my lifetime,.
18364 18364 We should take into account the possible side effects ( of further rate cuts ),.
18368 18368 If employers still have their workers on payroll, they will be able to turn the lights back on and deal with the rush of customers [ when demand rebounds ],.
18372 18372 I would say that we should maintain a respectable arm 's length with these people 's protests. I have not gone to Shaheen Bagh. My view is that we should not contaminate people 's movement with the virus of politics,.
18373 18373 Now the Scindias can get back their HUF ( Hindu Undivided Family ) Status.
18383 18383 Sometimes theatre for young people can be a bit bland, afraid to be controversial, but The Vultures' Song tackles tough issues in a way that is suitable for a younger age group.
18384 18384 The attention of the policymakers should have been concentrated on the economy and is instead distracted by political things, ethnic things and other things to do with ideology,.
18385 18385 This university 's mission can not succeed without careful attention to what voices we bring to the table and how we treat each other,.
18387 18387 I think the Sudanese government 's approval and the rebel movement 's acceptance to have ousted president Omar al-Bashir and 52 other indicted people handed over to the ICC for trial for crimes committed in Darfur is a popular demand,.
18390 18390 Makes me too happy to see [ Michael Ward ] nominated for a Bafta. This particular award is voted by the public so everyone who enjoyed Mike 's performance in Top Boy or Blue story should use this link and vote for him.
18393 18393 probably wo n't capture those queues that we saw around Centrelink offices a few weeks ago.
18400 18400 Investors are asking companies to produce disclosures on how they are lobbying, or that of their trade associations, is consistent on climate change, and to take action if this is not,.
18402 18402 Governments must call time on dirty gas, coal and oil, and on those companies wanting to keep the fossil-fuel addiction alive and kicking.
18404 18404 It 's important to recognize that the only reason big business may be quote-unquote at the table is because they want the preemption,.
18410 18410 Sergei, could you help me figure this thing out ?.
18413 18413 Slow wage growth is not good news for workers today, but it could be good news rolling into 2020.
18420 18420 Beyond CGD, there are also other diseases caused by proteins missing in white blood cells that could be treated in similar ways,.
18422 18422 Governments should be wary of high public debt even when borrowing costs seem low,.
18423 18423 I would like to thank @ DavidMalpassWBG for appointing me in this position. I would also like to thank president @ jokowi and the government of Indonesia for their support. I hope my experience in Indonesia can contribute to economic growth in many more developing countries,.
18426 18426 I know that resales lately have seemed quite strong year-over-year, but that 's because it was so weak a year ago.
18428 18428 Market expectations aside, Governor Poloz may well have reason enough to spend the remainder of his seven-year term in cruise control,.
18429 18429 As the COVID-19 situation evolves, Governing Council stands ready to adjust monetary policy further if required to support economic growth and keep inflation on target.
18431 18431 Unlikely at this point that the housing market would be fueled by banks' actions.
18432 18432 Probably [ the bank ] will focus now on what it has seen from its latest business and consumer surveys.
18433 18433 will not be announcing any new measures or actions.
18435 18435 We also need an awareness raising campaign about citizens' rights and we must keep a watchful eye on citizens' rights in the current talks between the two sides.
18436 18436 We pay them $ 15 and more to keep them. We offer health care benefits and time off. Sometimes, because of the union contracts, we ca n't give them more if they are doing a good job because they are locked in the rates.
18438 18438 If we give President Trump some credit for keeping the long Obama-era expansion on track, his stewardship has contributed to the low unemployment rate we 've recently enjoyed.
18447 18447 My vision would involve highlighting what would be considered the national interest. And that, I think, is much more difficult,.
18449 18449 We were expecting stimulus package and revival of GDP from the budget. Everything is a part of the economy whether it is new tax regime, affordable housing, education or MSME sector and the government has focused on most of these sectors especially the banking sector and NBFCs by giving them liberty and credit support. The government is also restructuring loans for micro small medium enterprises ( MSME ) sector and is trying to provide it with quest equity, which can increase the leveraging capacity of the sector,.
18452 18452 The question is whether it will be done and presented in a way that strengthens or weakens the political cohesion in the long-run.
18453 18453 I think we are going to see huge unemployment numbers, but they are not going to mean what they have ever meant in history,.
18454 18454 We sent everybody home in mid-March and at that time I committed to the firm that we were not going to terminate or change anyone 's compensation regardless of how long this last,.
18455 18455 The climate that seems to prevail among heads of state and the lack of European solidarity are a mortal danger to the EU. The microbe is back.
18457 18457 We were keen to make sure we did n't miss our charter flight. We got on the flight and from what I can remember it was a subdued gathering.
18460 18460 Certainly I think the ball is in the court of the politicians to prove otherwise.
18473 18473 A month ago, we did not know the that the spread of COVID-19 in developed countries could be very fast,.
18476 18476 While the redistribution favors oil importers, the risk is that vulnerable oil exporters will be forced to very drastic reductions in aggregate spending and demand and that could weigh on global economic activity,.
18480 18480 These outcomes are worse than were recorded during the global financial crisis or the European sovereign crisis.
18483 18483 The Trump administration is not requiring anyone to plan for or mitigate against the effects of climate change,.
18486 18486 Then, why did CEO Vicki Hollub and Chairman Gene Batchelder totally break these important vows and long-held principles, and instead chose to ` bet the Company' by incurring over $ 40 billion of debt ( including the preferred ) and paying a massive 65 % premium to ` win' a bidding war against Chevron ? Why did they decide to embark on this ill-advised bet that has already destroyed over $ 30 billion in stockholder value ; and if oil continues its decline, we believe will jeopardize the dividend, leaving stockholders to suffer even more ?.
18490 18490 Both the Right and the Left have redefined socialism, moreover, so that many young supporters now think that it just means a cuddlier, more equitable government,.
18492 18492 A fall in operating margins that lasted more than one or two years would likely produce a downgrade from Moody 's,.
18494 18494 nearly one-in-four workers -- 38.1 million out of 157.5 million -- are employed in the industries most likely to feel an immediate impact from the COVID-19 outbreak.
18495 18495 Students of color and economically disadvantaged students are less likely to participate in CTE statewide, but this disparity disappears when you compare more and less advantaged kids within the same high school,.
18497 18497 We 're going to work collaboratively with you, and partner with you to ensure that we can provide the best learning opportunities that are engaging and innovative for you and your students.
18498 18498 Europe 's high standards must not be called into question in the negotiations.
18501 18501 Like most supply-siders, the position she advocates may be summed up in the motto, ` I favor sound money -- and plenty of it.
18502 18502 We live in a time characterized by a feeling that we are no longer being assured an increasingly wide spread progress, but instead we are feeling like victims of the changes progress entails. This is a very sensitive movement, as many people can take advantage of suffering and frustration to impose restrictive visions, to impose and formulate ultra defensive campaigns, short term visions based on fears.
18505 18505 And with a lease, you can have a nicer car than you would with direct ownership.
18506 18506 I think it 's providing comfort to people too. I think it 's giving them something to do and a reason to wake up every morning and kind of keep a normal routine so to speak. I mean I 'm even fostering one which has been just a lot of fun.
18507 18507 The last message I would read into fewer [ tech ] IPOs is a lament,.
18511 18511 For charity c'mon Noel we can then go back to our amazing solo careers c'mon,.
18515 18515 I 've often thought, ` Let 's just do a gig.' But I realised I would only be doing it to shut this f * * king idiot up.
18516 18516 Whether it 's free WiFi or a fucking train up to fucking Scotland -- back and that in fucking zero time -- The Green Party are talking about real issues.
18517 18517 I think it 's really mind-boggling.
18520 18520 First and foremost we have to think about the safety and health of our citizens [ and ] forum participants,.
18524 18524 Less noticed has been the president 's dramatic signing statement .... [ in which ] he declared that his administration did not agree with these restrictions and therefore, might not abide by them ... The governance oversight that the Congress negotiated, in which the Treasury would NOT have sole discretion over the dispersal of funds, may not be intact,.
18526 18526 Precautionary measures as advised to the people of Sindh must be continued,.
18528 18528 We hope you 'll join us in supporting Second Harvest Food Bank -- or starting your own fundraiser for your local food bank,.
18531 18531 I think I 'm helping people remember that dating, for those who want to do it, is part of moving forward, and it is option B. If I could I would only date Dave. I made that choice. I just had that taken away from me.
18532 18532 I probably appreciate it even more on the other side.
18536 18536 There is no more feared or revered person today in the world of finance than Jamie Dimon.
18539 18539 has been slowing down naturally, transiting from what we can call high-speed to high-quality growth ....
18540 18540 Are we going to do it ? I actually think that we will, because when we are pushed we actually come together,.
18541 18541 China today has a much bigger share [ 19 per cent ] of the global economy than during the SARS epidemic [ eight per cent ]. So if things go bad for China, this is not good news for the rest of the world. But they [ China ] are working very hard to contain the epidemic.
18543 18543 We can be hard at the IMF, but we have a soft heart. This is no longer your grandmother 's IMF.
18544 18544 is negative -- a recession at least as bad as during the global financial crisis or worse,.
18545 18545 My advice would be to seek ways in which this element of uncertainty is reduced in the interests of everybody, of the U.K., of the EU, the whole world.
18550 18550 urgently seeking $ 18 billion in new loan resources for the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust, and will also likely need at least $ 1.8 billion in subsidy resources.
18555 18555 If we act, and act together, we can avoid repeating the mistakes of the 1920s in the 2020s,.
18561 18561 IMF staff is engaged with the authorities on how the [ IMF ] can further assist with their reform efforts and to help ensure that Sudan receives adequate external assistance.
18568 18568 So those who will be given equity do n't exceed more than about three percent or four percent of the existing shareholders.
18570 18570 We have n't got any help either from the Centre, or the state government or the Tea Board and have been recovering on our own,.
18571 18571 The virus will be around for some time. Social distancing or lockdowns are a must but we also have to slowly allow trade, exchange and markets to function. Otherwise, there can be a breakdown in food and essentials supply & sharp currency depreciation,.
18572 18572 What more NATO can do in the wider region to build long-term stability and security.
18573 18573 This dangerous situation must be de-escalated, and we urge an immediate return to the 2018 cease-fire to avoid the worsening of the horrendous humanitarian situation in the region,.
18575 18575 This dangerous situation must be de-escalated.
18576 18576 Ukraine 's new President Volodymyr Zelensky assumed office in May 2019 and reaffirmed his country 's strategic course of Euro-Atlantic integration. In October, the North Atlantic Council visited Odesa and Kyiv, and reiterated NATO 's commitment to providing continued practical assistance to Ukraine,.
18581 18581 However, on the other hand, if the agreement allows for a reasonable timeline for a responsible withdrawal and ensures intra-Afghan talks, there is room for hope about a substantive reduction in conflict and violence. Peace will require much more.
18585 18585 Iran must refrain from further violence and provocations.
18586 18586 Anything the health people want to do to save lives they should do,.
18587 18587 In France, they have a paid leave system, paid by the state. And if you operate a small business and your worker ca n't work right now, you 're going to continue to pay them and you 'll get reimbursed by the government for the person who ca n't work. It 's seamless. They 're getting paid the same. For the employer -- they 're getting reimbursed.
18591 18591 He got the company to the point here it 's for sure going to get through 2020 without changing anything. And then, depending on how the politics turns out, he may never have to change it.
18592 18592 If we see a substantial rise in oil prices it will be a problem for the oil-importing countries. Oil prices continue to be the key monitorable for Indian equities,.
18598 18598 We know it started in China. We do not know exactly how it started. We need to make demands of China. They might be pretty resistant at first blush, but we have to persevere,.
18601 18601 Our tourism industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus crisis, but it can play a critically important role helping slow the spread of the virus. This package will help businesses and jobs survive, as we do what 's needed to save lives.
18602 18602 I think that will be an issue and the other issue is there 's no guarantee any form of international travel will be back up and running by October.
18606 18606 ... It 's kind of a crazy situation where it looks like there may be a sort of [ collusion ] between the Republicans in South Carolina and the Russians to nominate the Democratic candidate for president,.
18609 18609 If there was ever a time for EPA to release an anti-science proposal, it is certainly not now. In fact, it 's hard to imagine a time when our nation needed to embrace science more than we do at this very moment. At a time when the American people are looking to the federal government to be guided by science and lead, and this proposal is far from what our country needs,.
18610 18610 With these major deficiencies on the climate front, the new NAFTA 's environment chapter can not be considered a template for future trade negotiations,.
18611 18611 It is ... possible that studies that could be usefully relied upon during a pandemic or other crisis would be systematically excluded from being used in EPA 's scientific and regulatory efforts well before the next pandemic or other crisis [ that ] occurs if this rule is finalized,.
18613 18613 received reports of seemingly purposeful and potentially unlawful efforts on the part of EPA political officials to avoid the standard processes and statutory requirements associated with proposing and finalizing these two high-profile rules, including potential efforts to conceal documents that should eventually be made public.
18618 18618 I believe in a few years time, when we look back on 2020, we may well see that it was the worst year in the history of global oil markets and, during that terrible year, the second quarter may have been the worst of the lot,.
18619 18619 We should n't forget that if there is a rebound of the economy ... we may well see a big rebound of emissions as well.
18623 18623 upbeat mood in the markets for a couple of days ( or ) couple of weeks, but people will realize there is still a huge amount of oil in the market.
18624 18624 back him in courts if he wants.
18627 18627 it was unfortunate for the country that after Syama Prasad Mookerjee and Babasaheb Ambedkar resigned from the government, their suggestions were not implemented as they should have been. Today, I would like to announce that Kolkata Port Trust will be known as Syama Prasad Mukherjee port.
18634 18634 From the projection that the central government made in its presentation during the meeting, it appears that there would be no money left by February 2020 to compensate states,.
18636 18636 People who had managed to claw back from the Great Recession and build up a bit of a cushion, they are probably burning through those reserves,.
18639 18639 The whole object is to bump up prices by dumping oil now. People should not get their hopes up for a gasoline price decrease over a prolonged period of time.
18641 18641 I suggested as treasurer three years ago to switch to a digital platform, and it 's working just fine. People like it, and it 's a whole lot cheaper. Yes, we do n't personally get together for the meeting anymore, but for a small corporation like ours, it makes all kinds of sense.
18643 18643 I congratulate Somalia for embracing important reforms that can do much to encourage sustainable poverty reduction, and I thank our international partners who have worked with us to bring Somalia to this important stage,.
18646 18646 The episode was a reminder that the world is not as safe a place as we thought it was,.
18649 18649 Our trade deficit with China might decrease, but our overall trade deficit would not,.
18652 18652 ca n't seem to get on the same page with the experts, the CDC,.
18654 18654 That would give us 23 million. We 've got a little more go. We 're probably three-quarters of the way there,.
18656 18656 I would like to assure the people of Sudan that I am safe and in good shape. Rest assured that what happened today will not stand in the way of our transition. Instead, it is an additional push to the wheel of change in Sudan,.
18659 18659 The second fiscal stimulus must support firms and households to survive through the crisis.
18660 18660 a renewed enthusiasm for investment in the country because I think that 's in our collective interest.
18661 18661 Whether or not the government has a small budget surplus from an economic perspective is not really that important,.
18666 18666 It is having a major effect on the education sector -- we are probably feeling that more than many other places,.
18667 18667 The list of areas where further investment would improve our future prospects is well known. It includes investments in infrastructure, in human capital, in energy production and distribution, in new data technologies, and in measures to deal with climate change and its effects.
18669 18669 The standard way of thinking for the past 20 years has been that monetary policy really is the stabiliser, deals with the economic cycle, and fiscal policy just deals with the structural issues. But with interest rates as low as they are there is limited scope in the future, probably, for monetary policy to play exactly the same role that it used to play.
18671 18671 may feel tired of the perception of China as being a Third World country.
18674 18674 Moreover, faster price appreciation in warmer Southern states reflect the ongoing migratory trend of people moving out of expensive regions of the country to more affordable parts. In 2020, more home-building activity and consequent growth in supply should tame down home price gains. That 's a healthy development for potential homebuyers. Southern cities should once again do better than most other markets.
18675 18675 The US spends nearly one-fifth of its GDP on health care but is failing to cope with a pandemic like COVID-19 because resource allocation has been driven by profit, not the safety of the masses. As vested financial interests resist the reallocation of resources, the economy is likely to be dragged down.
18677 18677 Enquiries about Invest North Bay should be directed to Ian Kilgour.
18678 18678 Where somebody grows up can be the single greatest determinant of their life outcome,.
18679 18679 We are going to do the peoples' business, but we are going to take social distancing steps, things that are smart behavioral practices to ensure that we can limit the risk associated with the spread of this virus.
18684 18684 I expect that there will be a budget. Especially in an election year, it would be incredibly risky and costly for both sides.
18686 18686 one can not have a true democracy with the kinds of large concentrations of market power and wealth that mark the US today.
18690 18690 If sustained, that 's more than enough to push the unemployment rate down to new lows, and to add upward pressure to wage growth,.
18693 18693 in theory ought to boost the manufacturing sector in the short term,.
18694 18694 The monthly numbers are noisy, though, and the trend is drifting down slowly, much less bad than the rollover implied by business surveys. This story seems unlikely to change much in the near future.
18695 18695 The Fed 's emergency actions Sunday appear to have scared investors into thinking that the Fed knows something they do n't. We think the latter is unlikely, but we do think that markets have been slow to grasp the scale of the problem.
18699 18699 With Sidewalk it is not an either or,.
18702 18702 are spot assets and must clear the surpluses developing today from weak demand and rising supply.
18704 18704 Basically, there is no data that shows applying excise will reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases and obesity, if that 's the intention,.
18709 18709 Can monetary policy address output and stable prices and something called financial conditions ? You need another tool,.
18710 18710 This means the cells are perfectly matched to the patient and it should be a much safer transplant, without the risks of rejection.
18712 18712 the remaining 97 percent of companies -- about 22,200 -- would pay no tax under the proposal.
18716 18716 He had gotten them and given them to the staff. They told me they were going to the game, but they did n't go. Thought about it last year and thought what about if the Chiefs win ? And here we are, 50 years later.
18721 18721 This should ease those financing constraints for the provinces, and at least give them predictability for their near-term cash flows,.
18723 18723 I think ( Poloz ) will be pleased to see that rebound in jobs numbers in December,.
18726 18726 Much of governing council 's deliberations focused on how persistent this recent slowdown in the domestic economy might be,.
18729 18729 what every self-respecting news outlet ought to be.
18730 18730 All of the Riksbank 's tools can be put to use,.
18731 18731 And then think about people who are in a hard place and give that.
18732 18732 At the moment we should do whatever we can to provide resources to keep the growth rate at the minimum declining level, increase jobs, raise demand and availability of goods and services. It is key to look at the current situation this way, rather than saying I wo n't do this or that.
18735 18735 It 's the President who can put the federal government on any calendar he wants.
18736 18736 Price stability is that state in which expected changes in the general price level do not effectively alter business or household decisions.
18739 18739 Students are taking rigorous courses and doing well, but still not scoring as high on their tests. Earning the grades they need to be college-ready should be paramount.
18740 18740 [ Here ] you can hit a wall and you 're OK. There is no reset in real life.
18742 18742 The discussions and pervasive sentiments at Davos might have lulled Chinese policymakers,.
18743 18743 It should also be noted that this exercise is performed as a deterministic simulation and hence does not capture the potential benefits of the asset purchase program in mitigating downside risks to economic activity and inflation.
18744 18744 We could see a significant impact on Europe, which has been weak to start with, and it 's just conceivable that it could throw the United States into a recession,.
18746 18746 Kudos @ PiyushGoyal you are absolutely right. Kindly enlighten Shri @ amitabhk87 also, because he seems to be deeply impressed by the company, especially $ 1 billion.
18749 18749 You must realise, in a democracy, there is nothing wrong to have dissent within the party. I do n't think there 's much merit in running a party in a way in which everyone in a party simply endorses what the party leadership thinks. This is an example of democratic dissent surfacing ( within the party ). In my view nothing wrong with it.
18753 18753 The aspirational growth rate could be between 6.5 percent to 7 percent. At this stage it will be difficult to attain nine per cent GDP growth,.
18754 18754 I think it 's really important to balance out the economic consequences with the health consequences,.
18760 18760 There is certain evidence that I would like to have seen led in this trial but for a variety of reasons we were not able to do so.
18762 18762 If you 're charging over $ 1.50, indeed, if you 're charging over $ 1.40, that 's price-gouging,.
18763 18763 Even if it 's less than [ cartel behaviour ] you can also deal with it now under concerted practices.
18767 18767 Once the crisis is over measures can be unwound and that 's the best way to get recovery -- losing competitive dynamic through this crisis would be a tragedy.
18780 18780 We want to solve the problem of borrowing from loan sharks and since it 's a mutual facility people can opt out.
18783 18783 We think what we do is very necessary, and business thinks so too,.
18786 18786 was much more on the micro side, but I thought that answers could be found by putting micro into macro.
18788 18788 It is open to debate whether we need special rules for green ... investments,.
18794 18794 That can make it easier for workers to contemplate going on strike.
18796 18796 If you get the coronavirus and are quarantined, we 're talking about two weeks, we 're not talking about five days,.
18802 18802 I think we 're talking about a very intensive time of negotiations and talks between the four parties in the next few days. I do n't think we 're talking about months or weeks, I think we 're talking about something happening fairly soon and getting a good result in the near future.
18803 18803 the amount of money earmarked for public transport initiatives in the National Development Plan may not be sufficient to fund the full scope of work envisaged on those projects.
18804 18804 We anticipate that within days we 'll have another meeting, possibly with members of UEFA and, finally, if we do get substantial progress, we 'll hopefully have another meeting with all of the stakeholders together.
18806 18806 Any weakness to these and other companies would likely push earnings estimates lower,.
18810 18810 It really seems to be the diversity of economics that makes it do well in influencing other fields,.
18812 18812 From what I have read in the newspapers, her main fault is she had uploaded some protest rally images on the Internet. It is difficult to assess whether it is a strong enough logic to ask her to leave the country for this act,.
18816 18816 We could n't be more pleased with how well GOAU has performed since its debut two and a half years ago,.
18819 18819 We 'll probably have to talk about that as well,.
18820 18820 But I do think it would have an adverse effect on our job under the Constitution, and that has to come first.
18822 18822 there seems to be a sense in which insiders have managed to stack the deck against outsiders.
18823 18823 We should implement a regime that would allow the return of Russians with appropriate quarantine measures and the possibility of Chinese citizens leaving Russia,.
18824 18824 False reports on a fairly large number of infected people in Russia claiming that the authorities hide this information have appeared in social networks recently. Let me stress once again that this is not true. The special task team and the Russian government, all agencies, which oversee the situation, as well as regions, are involved in preventive work,.
18825 18825 You 've got to engage in the very best public health you can because the downside is really that bad.
18827 18827 And I think that 's a big negative.
18831 18831 If forecasts turn out the way the Bank is expecting, I do not think we need to see an interest rate cut.
18837 18837 One more extreme event in the Philippines, for example, one more Supertyphoon ` Yolanda' ( international name : Haiyan ) or Typhoon ` Pablo' ( Bopha ) or Tropical Storm ` Ondoy' ( Ketsana ), would strain the country 's ability to cope,.
18838 18838 If the U.S. government is going to assist other countries, let alone provide some kind of leadership role during this global crisis, the first thing it should do is 'cause no harm,'.
18840 18840 Some people want cash back ... Other people pick credit cards that are aligned to discounts on fuel. So if you commute a lot, you spend a lot of money. Sometimes those credit cards linked to gas discounts at the pump could be like six cents off per litre.
18842 18842 When you 're worried about errors of commission, defensive medicine can lead to [ less ] treatment of patients,.
18844 18844 Right now, the border is our lifeline. I think Trudeau knows this and Trump, well, he knows it but the question is : does he really care ? I think he is being recognized as a leader who really did n't see the gravity of the situation at first,.
18846 18846 Going on a global gold standard would provide a much more democratic international monetary system than the one that exists today ....
18848 18848 We need to think deeply about how to keep severely impacted businesses afloat,.
18854 18854 But if it continues to be uncontrolled through the [ northern hemisphere 's ] summer then Australian firms are going to have to cut back production significantly -- and that 's just a microcosm of the threat around the world.
18855 18855 It 's highly likely that there 's very strong growth at least in the first half of the year that is sort of tempered later by threats over election uncertainty, which tend to slow things down a bit,.
18858 18858 It can be difficult in today 's information-rich society to know exactly where to go for knowledge about how to keep yourself and your loved ones safe,.
18860 18860 It is still too soon to even speculate about either the size or the persistence.
18861 18861 was the land of low prices and free markets, where you had a lot of choices, be it for flying around, buying a cell phone or getting on the internet.
18863 18863 We will want to open malls, but that will take time. I do n't believe it will happen in April, perhaps sometime in May, depending on the numbers we see and how citizens comply with regulations and restrictions,.
18864 18864 It is definitely a shame, but I do n't know what could be done to save it, really. Unfortunately there 's not much to come to Whitehaven for on a Saturday anymore, so the car park was n't being used.
18868 18868 A janitor, however skilled at his job, can only clean one building at a time.
18870 18870 Given the scale of the climate challenge and the rising expectations of our citizens, 2020 must be a year of climate action where everybody 's in, and that includes the world 's leading financial centre. To identify the largest opportunities and to manage the associated risks, disclosures of climate risk must become comprehensive, climate risk management must be transformed, and investing for a net-zero world must go mainstream.
18874 18874 It is our position that legally several of the charges can not be sustained and therefore as a matter of law should be dismissed before it ever reaches the jury,.
18879 18879 What if you ask and they say yes ? Consumers' willingness to disclose personal data is stronger than you think,.
18882 18882 I would guess that just about every factory in the great coastal manufacturing hubs of Guangdong Province and Shenzhen, the Shanghai -- Suzhou -- Nanjing corridor, or around Chongqing in Sichuan Province has some workers who went home to Wuhan or another contagion area for the holiday,.
18883 18883 LGBTQ youth are 120 percent more likely to experience homelessness than their straight and cisgender peers. Transgender youth are at especially high risk and face unique types of discrimination and trauma while experiencing homelessness. Young people should never have to fear discrimination or violence in seeking services, and we must not fail them by rolling back the very policies meant to protect them.

18885 18885 The franchise fees can kill you,.
18889 18889 The board will meet this week and it should be ratified then. There is a process in which a board ratifies its chairman and that 's where we are at this time. I believe in collective responsibility so I will speak in detail later about my plans,.
18893 18893 Perhaps this rise of alternative working, insecure arrangements may have contributed at least in part to that flat-lining of productivity,.
18895 18895 We 're hoping the refineries like Domino can crank out as much sugar as they can,.
18900 18900 This blindness suggests that information bearing on the economy 's near-term path is rapidly available to all, but rare events such as recessions are fundamentally unforecastable.
18904 18904 crucial that policymakers continue to monitor the buildup of financial vulnerabilities and take steps to address them where appropriate in order to reduce the chance that such vulnerabilities may amplify the adverse impact of shocks to the global economy.
18909 18909 when the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of growth of output and income, as it did in the nineteenth century and seems quite likely to do again in the twenty-first, capitalism automatically generates arbitrary and unsustainable inequalities.
18910 18910 taxes a certain level of income or inheritance at a rate of 70 or 80 percent, the primary goal is obviously not to raise additional revenue ( because these high brackets never yield much ).
18911 18911 I think what 's responsible and fair and reasonable is for everybody to do what they can,.
18912 18912 It 's all really strange. If you look at the numbers and data, it makes no sense,.
18913 18913 Misperceptions and biases against immigrants can interact and reinforce each other,.
18916 18916 Our current research suggests it could be exactly the opposite.
18931 18931 There 's real concern that the response to this would be to just throw up our arms.
18932 18932 This can certainly work, at least to a certain extent,.
18937 18937 Added to this, many young people will also have progressed on to A-Levels or into jobs and may not be able to return to school and who will be available to do the marking of all these tests, in the middle of a busy academic year ?.
18938 18938 That is the critical preparation, so you can not just rebalance but take advantage of the liquidation. Rebalancing is critically important and goes to the maintenance of your long-term risk appetite.
18941 18941 Agricultural production is seasonal by nature, so for a lot of foods or commodities, it 's produced in the summer or certain times of year and then stored,.
18944 18944 QE and forward guidance should be part of the standard toolkit going forward,.
18945 18945 can largely compensate for the effects of the lower bound,.
18950 18950 What can I say, I have a boisterous character. Whether it 's up or down, I react.
18960 18960 Hey, look, I could do this commute three days a week. But not five.
18962 18962 In the event that the games are postponed the obviously there would be some degree of negative impact to Japanese economic growth in fiscal [ year 2020 ],.
18965 18965 The word we should use is transition,.
18967 18967 These practices are intertwined and should be studied in the context of the Malaysian agricultural industry to ensure that the best practices are implemented here, for the benefit of our farmers and Malaysians as a whole,.
18968 18968 ID2020 ... if applied, would roll out the contours of what some analysts have described as a Global Police State encompassing through vaccination the personal details of several billion people worldwide.
18975 18975 Focus on the company management. Good managers in a bad business are better than bad managers in a good business. An investor should chase the story behind his investment, not the money on the table. Money can make you rich, but the story can make you wealthy,.
18976 18976 Global recession is not likely, but I am convinced that a continuation of current slowdown is likely. There could be an escalation of tensions in Iran. Even though trade war risks have reduced, the rivalry between the US and China will stay with us. The idea that there will be a cold war between these two in the next decade is getting widespread,.
18978 18978 After finally taking action following much dither and delay, it would be a backwards step for the Government to pass Northern 's services straight back into private hands.
18979 18979 These companies are good companies. Occidental, Hewlett-Packard ... there are companies that should be bought. On the other hand, there are many very overpriced companies with very high multiples and too much debt on them and those should be sold,.
18981 18981 If you put rocket fuel in a really nice car, you 're going to blow up that car,.
18984 18984 Such restructuring can be welcome if it helps the system to cope with the shock. At the same time, the European Commission and EU member states are aware that in such a situation, strategic assets need to be protected,.
18986 18986 But, for such talent to be won in the medium term, the gap in quality between China 's civilian and military universities needs to be narrowed in the short term. Military-civil fusion, a policy promoted by General Secretary Xi Jinping, will help relatively PLA scientists leverage expertise from China 's growing cadre of civilian researchers through more frequent research collaborations. Whether or not that leads to China 's top scientific talent going to the PLA 's best engineering universities remains to be seen,.
18987 18987 Earnings projections will come down. The fear of the virus alone could hurt consumer confidence in the U.S.
18988 18988 Furthermore, public exposure can limit support for unpopular, but just, causes. Laws requiring disclosure were used to intimidate opponents of Jim Crow in the American South, for example. Whether people like it or not, there is a free speech issue involved.
18994 18994 The results imply that human well-being 's curved shape is not uniquely human and that, although it may be partly explained by aspects of human life and society, its origins may lie partly in the biology we share with great apes,.
18995 18995 According to Ruggles, the prevalence of extended families living together roughly doubled from 1750 to 1900, and this way of life was more common than at any time before or since,.
18996 18996 Enemy of communal harmony and fraternity are stoking religious sentiments to cover up own blunders. Most Indian media houses are lighting the fire of enmity and hatred. Instead, let 's fight corona and more importantly starvation crisis in India unitedly without giving it a communal angle, specifically relating it to Tablighi Jamaat, Muslims or other religious groups,.
19003 19003 Have you been laid off during this pandemic ? Lost wages due to stay-at-home orders ? Were you unable to pay April rent or mortgage ? What about May -- is that looking impossible ?.
19007 19007 In an enclosed environment, in close proximity to individuals, they may be at even greater risk,.
19008 19008 It can take up to around three weeks to succumb to infection from initial exposure, so whatever numbers of deaths we have, they can tell us how many cases in total we had three weeks ago,.
19009 19009 The writing is on the wall ... Italy will not be able to respond to the crisis in the same way that other countries can. It is at risk of an economic depression on top of a humanitarian catastrophe,.
19014 19014 This EPA rule was developed after an explosion leveled the town of West, Texas and killed 15 people in 2013. The Chemical Safety Board investigated the incident and determined that different ways of handling the chemicals could have prevented the accident from happening in the first place.
19023 19023 There is no gate or fence. This is going to be a place for the public and for human interaction. There are more than 1,000 people at Portside, and then the community at large will be able to be involved too. I think the synergy is going to be great when it is all finished. This will have a great communal focus.
19026 19026 When you 're already on a fixed or limited income, the thought of ` Oh my goodness, how much is this going to cost me ?' A lot of times people come in and say, ` It was going to cost me $ 1,400. I ca n't afford that,.
19027 19027 A peaceful revolution that lasted for over five, six months. Very resilient. Every time we thought it 's dying, it surprises, it 's taking more momentum. So that gives us not only hope but also certainty that Sudan will never be the same again,.
19033 19033 With agriculture you ca n't postpone seasons. COVID has its own agenda which may force industries to halt activities - including fisheries.
19035 19035 Even if today in Munich the skies may be gray, it does n't mean that the future of Germany is dark,.
19044 19044 It is now clear that we have entered a recession -- as bad as or worse than in 2009,.
19045 19045 bad or worse than the global financial crisis in 2009.
19051 19051 The CCRT can currently provide about $ 500 million in grant-based debt service relief, including the recent $ 185 million pledge by the UK and $ 100 million provided by Japan as immediately available resources. Others, including China and the Netherlands, are also stepping forward with important contributions. I urge other donors to help us replenish the Trust 's resources and boost further our ability to provide additional debt service relief for a full two years to our poorest member countries.
19056 19056 But we are not excluding that it might turn to be a different scenario,.
19057 19057 To support jobs and firms, governments may need to take ownership stakes in strategically important firms. To avert a financial crisis, they may need to recapitalise banks and absorb non-performing assets.
19058 19058 How can we make capital flows safer for emerging-market economies ? Finding the right response to that question is critical for financial stability, growth and jobs,.
19059 19059 There was indeed a slowdown in the short term and then a rebound, I think, in economic growth over the course of the whole year. It was as if it kind of evened up. Would that be the case now ? It is very hard to predict.
19063 19063 Before we protest, I believe it is critical that we understand exactly what it is that we 're protesting against. The logic of protest must be founded not on quarrels or arguments, but on the creative power of dialectics.
19068 19068 Air India disinvestment process restarts today https : //thehindubusinessline.com/economy/logistics/air-india-disinvestment-government-to-sell-100-stake-issues-bid-document/article30662876.ece… : THIS DEAL IS WHOLLY ANTI NATIONAL and IWILL FORCED TO GO TO COURT. WE can not SELL OUR FAMILY SILVER.
19070 19070 This does n't mean that only Hindus can be Prime Ministers. Hindus in this country have never said that. Furthermore, we say that all religions lead to God. Which other religion says that apart from Hinduism ?.
19072 19072 If the virus can be defeated in the next few months, its impact on the world economy and the euro zone economy will be very limited and measured in tenths of a percent,.
19075 19075 My judgement is that if the Reserve Bank had not eased monetary policy last year, ( the ) adjustment by households would have been harder.
19077 19077 We have experienced a troubling decline in productivity growth. While the reasons for this are complex, it is hard to escape the conclusion that higher levels of investment spending would promote productivity growth and our collective living standards,.
19078 19078 I think it is quite likely that the international spillovers will be larger than they were back in 2003 with SARS.
19083 19083 We should be owning the ethical and environmental agenda. I think in 2020 the partnership values are more important than ever. More than ten years since the financial crisis and as a country we are still asking : is business doing its role to create a good society, good jobs and decent pay ?.
19085 19085 this would depend on the Taliban continuing to reduce violence,.
19091 19091 We would welcome any step that can lead to the reduction of violence,.
19100 19100 I think there needs to be lots more experience and evaluation of the concepts of financial insurance.
19101 19101 Chandrapur is already facing a space crunch for tigers. Given the non-committal approach of the irrigation department about either shifting the project upstream or adhering to mitigation measures suggested by NTCA, the CM directing authorities to revisit the proposal is wonderful news. Hope this spirit gets applied in other projects as well where wildlife generally ends up paying the price of development,.
19102 19102 Frequent changing of the mask, mask free time in between if possible may be practised to prevent these dermatological adverse effects,.
19104 19104 The consultations so far have revealed how strongly all stakeholders feel about the need for radical reforms in the water sector and the incredible consensus that seems to be emerging around the broad contours of this reform towards greater democratisation, multi-disciplinarity and the need to break down silos into which we have divided water,.
19109 19109 We need to guard against voter apathy as we sign up such alliances, however. If we get a true majority, it will require such a coalition. We need to be more futuristic about the nature of such an alliance, one that focuses on making a contribution, not just being about the individual.
19113 19113 Talking about coronavirus could soon be considered troubling for public opinion, undermining public security and insulting the president !.
19114 19114 A 22-year-old would also say, ` Do n't blow this.'.
19115 19115 We welcome their ideas. I think we 've just got to figure out what is the right balanced approach to invest in communities to create real peace and safety.
19116 19116 I think that the odds of a global recession are close to 100 per cent right now,.
19121 19121 I think this is going to be a short-time hit ; we 'll get the economy back to its usual level,.
19123 19123 We would be delighted to have you personally and COMESA as an organization to join us in September for this important event,.
19125 19125 Throughout the remainder of this term, our faculty and staff will do everything they can to stay connected with you,.
19126 19126 One thing you wo n't hear from me is ` goodbye.' Because while we may have temporarily gone our separate ways, our journey together continues.
19130 19130 Consistent with their declared ` symmetric' inflation targets, the Federal Reserve and other central banks should defend against inflation that is too low as least as vigorously as they resist inflation that is modestly too high.
19135 19135 It 's going to be something like that, not something we can see in the immediate future.
19139 19139 Right away we went to the WHO and said to them, ` You tell us. Whatever you think is imminent harm comes down.' We 're relying on third-party experts.
19140 19140 They do n't hand the reins of their educations or careers to someone else -- but they wait for their boyfriends to make this huge decision for them,.
19142 19142 Hunger touches every community in the U.S., and it can be particularly hard on families during emergency situations,.
19145 19145 As a mother, I can not imagine the indescribable grief Jacob Marberger 's parents must be going through ; my heart aches for them,.
19146 19146 Even if ( the ) death rate is low, it will be because containment has been effective, and that will adversely affect aggregate supply and demand,.
19149 19149 I think there will be a rethinking on another level,.
19150 19150 If I was scared, I would n't post half the tweets I do. Ask anyone who has been to any of my speeches or public gatherings in the past 3 years, and they 'll recognize that joke.
19155 19155 By Wednesday, March 18th at 12:30 p.m., when I appeared on CNBC, we had already sold slightly more than half of the notional amount of our CDS, realizing a gain of more than $ 1.3 billion, with the unrealized portion of our hedge having a market value at that time of $ 1.3 billion for a total of $ 2.6 billion,.
19162 19162 debt moratoria and restructuring may need to be considered,.
19163 19163 global GDP would fall even further : an additional 3 percent in 2020 if the pandemic is more protracted this year, while, if the pandemic continues into 2021, it may fall next year by an additional 8 percent compared to our baseline scenario.
19166 19166 We do not consider that these concerns can be adequately mitigated. As such we urge the bank not to proceed with financing this project, but to seek opportunities instead to finance genuine renewable infrastructure to help meet the region 's energy needs in a clean and rights-compatible manner in the decades to come,.
19169 19169 For all of humanity 's history, people have wanted to live longer, and to choose where they can live,.
19170 19170 If you think about it today, we are so removed from where we get our electricity, our gas, everything to do with energy.
19172 19172 Let it be clear to all e-commerce companies in India and to all those who have somehow misinterpreted or misunderstood the # MHA guidelines. Delivery of only and only essential goods has been permitted even after 20th April. There is absolutely no confusion whatsoever.
19174 19174 The decision to not join RCEP was very unfortunate. The government said we must ` Act East'. Refusing to join RCEP is not Acting East, it is sitting on the shore and saying, no, thank you very much,.
19177 19177 We 'd love to do more. We would love to ( test ) people who do n't have symptoms. Unfortunately, we 're limited by supplies and lab capacity.
19178 19178 Up to 80 per cent of coal assets will be stranded, ( and ) up to half of developed oil reserves. A question for every company, every financial institution, every asset manager, pension fund or insurer : what 's your plan ?.
19186 19186 We are going to experience a sharp collapse in output for one month. We have to spend 2 per cent on medical side which is slightly underestimated ... For one month output loss even if we make up one third of output loss by social cushioning or propping up financial system, still it would be 3 per cent of GDP. So, the number we came up with Rs 10 lakh crore ( Centre and states combined ) or 5 per cent of the GDP,.
19187 19187 As concerns about the veracity of India 's GDP growth rates may generate substantial concerns not only to investors but also to policymakers, this issue warrants a careful examination.
19189 19189 We must be very careful because it will affect our economy,.
19190 19190 advance payment of ( at least ) three months' pension should be made immediately, to help widows and the elderly who are the most vulnerable in this crisis.
19191 19191 One of them is that no one should be allowed to starve.
19195 19195 So I had to get through the ceremony and make my speech, and got out of there as quick as I could.
19204 19204 all these folks who 've seen their nest egg wiped out. They thought they were set for retirement and they 're not. They 'll go into panic mode.
19206 19206 The only way to avoid a recession would be a quick and very aggressive fiscal policy response by the Trump administration,.
19207 19207 The Bureau of Labor Statistics may understate the case,.
19209 19209 would not have chosen.
19213 19213 It is important that these short-term measures do not give rise to long-term structural damage to competition, market concentration or long-term arrangements that make it more difficult for businesses to enter and compete into the future,.
19217 19217 These authorisations will help ensure that hospitals and health authorities in Victoria and Queensland can take necessary steps to provide co-ordinated and consistent care for what may be a significant rise in patients.
19220 19220 Apparently Twitter ban accounts who say the c word Liam, do you reckon they 'll try and ban you ?.
19227 19227 If you 're doing potentially hundreds of thousands or millions of trades, even a small amount of profitability per trade turns out to be a big amount.
19230 19230 Once the Chinese have their act together, I think that may serve as a source of inspiration for a lot of other nations,.
19232 19232 In most developed countries, interest rates are really low -- and they are very low in the United States, but higher than they are in most other developed economies. And the Fed does have some scope -- it 's not a cure-all. But it will provide a little bit of support to consumer spending and to the U.S. economy and for financial markets. And, of course, if it becomes very serious, fiscal policy could play a more active role, too.
19237 19237 If you step back and look at the trend, it 's about 2 %, and the coronavirus notwithstanding, I ca n't see any reason why it would n't continue,.
19240 19240 Firms appear to have met demand by running down inventory, but that ca n't go on forever.
19242 19242 We expect a bigger fall in April, which should be the floor if restrictions begin to ease in early May in some states and across the whole country by the end of the month.
19247 19247 I 'm not going to itemize what could cause us to move earlier or not move earlier at this stage.
19248 19248 The fact is, the fundamental demand for housing appears to be outpacing our ability to build new homes, which can put renewed upward pressure on prices,.
19251 19251 We 'd be happy if we cover our costs initially,.
19259 19259 The lockdown keeps people at home which is not necessarily that pristine isolated place, but can also be a slum where people live together,.
19263 19263 The longer they can hold out before taking drastic action, the better off they will be.
19268 19268 After fielding questions and talking to as many guys as I could, and formulating my own opionions, I felt like this deal was going to be in the best benefit for the majority of the league, and especially our locker room,.
19269 19269 Well, if the Fed has missed its inflation target, why would anyone have any confidence on level targeting ?.
19271 19271 I sincerely understand the plight faced by most citizens. But it is important that we also contribute in ensuring that the virus does not spread by abiding to recommendations made by Government. We should also not lose sight that we are still in a drought situation. Government is doing its part to ensure that there is mealie-meal in the country. We should also shop responsibly by stopping to hoard products,.
19273 19273 We are aware that there are people who sell 10kg roller meal at $ 105 or plus which is increasing panic among people,.
19274 19274 In that case, you could actually have a pretty nice expansion of the economy.
19278 19278 We 're looking for whether people will be laid off, and if companies can roll over loans.
19281 19281 Open banking will enable consumers to face various bodies that would need to compete for them and could change the financial system,.
19283 19283 the Chinese economy had a great deal of positive momentum. In that sense, I do not think we should expect the kind of rapid recovery seen after that virus outbreak subsided.
19284 19284 The intent should not be to trip people up. It should not be to create a system that is so impossible that you need to have a Ph.D. to figure out what 's going on,.
19287 19287 But being only debt-free is not important, growth should also accompany it. Debt is not all bad, if it comes with 10-20 per cent growth. I will prefer that instead of a business with zero debt and no growth,.
19288 19288 I do n't understand why you think it 's okay to do that to somebody.
19291 19291 The NHS, itself, puts great emphasis on the cost, in money and time, of missed appointments to over-burdened clinics. So, giving patients accessible information makes sense. More worryingly, as many sight loss conditions are progressive, any delays in treatment could mean unnecessary deterioration in sight,.
19292 19292 I 'm delighted to be able to stay a part of this great squad for the next few years, and I believe we can bring further success to this club.
19295 19295 This means that we should look at the numbers that come out [ Thursday ] as just the leading edge of the labor market impact of the coronavirus shock.
19298 19298 Ang private sector dahil sila ay may autonomy na mag-isip ng anong paraan para ma-achieve din ang goals nila ... pero ang purpose ay ibalanse ang safety ng learners, containment of COVID-19, and hindi madisrupt ang buhay ng mga bata sa kanilang learning process,.
19300 19300 But if you have an inventory shortage, it makes it more difficult for renters to become homeowners.
19301 19301 If stimulus is rightly structured to help these companies and if a vaccine is discovered, then the housing demand will roar back,.
19303 19303 Expect second-quarter home sales activity to slow down with the broad observance of stay-at-home orders, but sales will pick up when the economy reopens as many potential home buyers and sellers indicate they 're still in the market or will be in a couple of months,.
19304 19304 Mortgage rates are expected to hold under four percent for most of 2020, while net job creation will likely exceed two million,.
19307 19307 Now, let me be clear, national security is a legitimate concern, but I believe we must be wary of policy that undercuts the strength of the very institutions that make coming to the United States worthwhile,.
19308 19308 may be a permanent change in the structure of the economy and supply chains may shift permanently.
19311 19311 The real issues going forward are likely to be whether food industry workers can stay healthy.
19318 19318 During lunch, I interacted with some alumni of the Tony Elumelu Entrepreneurship programme who said they were beneficiaries of $ 5,000 support in 2015 from the TEF, and today, they have just completed raising $ 3million becoming one of the biggest food chain providers in Rwanda. These are some examples of what such interventions can do. We support, give them an enabling environment, provide a platform and think of our prosperity in a sustainable fashion,.
19319 19319 I just want to bring something that was family friendly to El Paso. Something that includes the whole family. Kids can come and play and the adults can come and hang out.
19320 19320 I would n't put all my eggs in that basket,.
19321 19321 I would have preferred that that was built into the legislation upfront,.
19322 19322 ( w ) e should certainly be prepared for a meaningful level of deliberate suppression of economic activity for the rest of the year.
19327 19327 Despite widespread expectations global energy-related CO2 emissions would post another annual increase in 2019, new @ IEA data shows they were unchanged at 33 gigatonnes even as the world economy expanded by 2.9 %,.
19330 19330 The progress this will achieve in transforming countries' energy infrastructure wo n't be temporary -- it can make a lasting difference to our future,.
19331 19331 Today 3 billion people in the world are locked down. As a result of that, we may see demand fall.
19335 19335 There is the paradox of course that if there is trouble anywhere in the world -- including in the U.S. -- people bring their money to the U.S. for safekeeping,.
19338 19338 Construction activities have already halved as the implementation of projects, small or large, has slowed,.
19339 19339 Even if you 're not freaked out about a pandemic, you worry that everyone else is and they 'll stockpile ... and you do n't want to be left paperless,.
19343 19343 The individuals who become ill, who are quarantined, who are not able to go to work -- there 's a nontrivial number of workers that if they do not show up to work for two weeks, they lose their job,.
19344 19344 real person 's specific life or experience.
19345 19345 -- or as stylized as the violence that 's portrayed in the ` 70s,.
19346 19346 I think sometimes the best way for us to grapple with the truths of our reality and our present is to see it through a different prism and a different lens,.
19348 19348 The number of people who have never heard of the Holocaust or who have heard of it but think it did n't happen is shocking. The point of this series is to carry on my grandmother 's story and teach people the truth.
19352 19352 I do n't think many will think that is a profit-enhancing shift,.
19353 19353 If you can get cars to self-drive, why ca n't we solve this ?.
19356 19356 The most practical thing that ordinary Victorians can do right now to help these regions is to travel there and spend money there,.
19357 19357 The time and expense incurred by OXY to fight our simple request is extraordinary ; it 's as if the Company 's future depends on Hollub and Batchelder keeping their secrets secret,.
19361 19361 I think the Recovery Act was hamstrung by that, and it did n't work as well as it should have.
19365 19365 These are the complementary economic measures, that in the short run, when people can neither work nor consume as freely as they would have, are absolutely essential to minimize the economic pain and prevent short-term economic shocks.
19370 19370 Once the central bank buys them, it 's as if the Treasury never issued them in the first place,.
19371 19371 We do n't have increasing inflationary pressures. The trillion-dollar deficit is perfectly fine and we could probably go higher.
19373 19373 I think most Wall Street Journal readers realize that the journal is the top echelon of business journalism and they 're not going to publish anything that has n't been seriously vetted and checked for accuracy.
19375 19375 There 's constraints on inequality at the top so that some can not amass a great deal of economic power that translates into social and political power. And so long as there are countervailing forces across the economy, that can be a counterweight to concentrated economic power.
19376 19376 We can brag we have the most expensive healthcare. We can also now brag that it delivers the worst health of any rich country,.
19377 19377 That 's about as hopeful as I can be.
19385 19385 made more than $ 350,000 last year to infrequently write stories that generated little meaningful viewership or revenue.
19386 19386 While the Committee would like to see inflation expectations anchored closer to the mid-point of the inflation target range on a sustained basis, the lower inflation forecast and improved risk profile opens some space to provide further policy accommodation to the economy.
19389 19389 Bad governance lies at the center of Africa 's failure to sustain peace. When conflicts persist, girls drop out of school and we lose Africa 's brain trust. Women and girls must not be used as or for conflict,.
19390 19390 If you 're a country like Nigeria, which is a net oil exporter -- one, we 're demanding less oil from you, but secondly the amount of oil that we 're demanding from you has dropped [ in price ]. We 've estimated that Nigeria could lose almost $ 19 billion if the trend continues and that 's a big shock to Nigeria 's economy, which was already growing at quite a low rate of 2.8 percent.
19391 19391 Africa may lose half of its GDP with growth falling from 3.2 % to about 2 % due to a number of reasons which include the disruption of global supply chains,.
19392 19392 How many people would be in how big a room ?.
19394 19394 In my opinion, a difference of opinion about whether this employment land expansion is good planning does not change the fact that the town and the city are working together on a number of issues,.
19396 19396 Steve Schwarzman exemplifies modern global financial capitalism. This book offers with great clarity his thoughts on everything from family life to global capital markets. It should be of interest to anyone trying to make a big mark on today 's complex global economy.
19397 19397 We do hope that the Indian government will reconsider its decision. We are discussing this through our diplomatic channel, if necessary we can also go through the political channel,.
19401 19401 Notably, a dash for government bonds, which remain at their yield lows for the year, and precious metals, suggest at least some investors are seeking protection from a decline in global growth expectations,.
19405 19405 must be flexible enough to fix it along the way,.
19408 19408 may undermine the pillars of the EU.
19409 19409 the road ahead will be much tougher for rural areas ... Job growth is likely to remain flat for the next decade in many rural counties, and it could continue to shrink in the most distressed areas.
19414 19414 Babies born in the Ville [ neighborhood ] are six times more likely to have a low birth rate and twice as likely to die before their first birthday, compared to babies in Clayton,.
19416 19416 I propose to think of capitalism as the particular form that proprietarianism assumed in the era of heavy industry and international financial investment, that is, primarily in the second half of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
19417 19417 must enjoy a minimum degree of plausibility if the system is to endure.
19423 19423 This would happen if the EU and the UK are unable to agree on a timely trade deal. And if there is no mutual consensus on extending the transitional period beyond 2020,.
19424 19424 We now have to start a national movement on how we can protect our waterways not only for ourselves, but also for our future generations as our entire activities are dependent on waterways,.
19425 19425 All workers should have been covered, with government grants to businesses to help them absorb the cost,.
19426 19426 Some people think if you do n't hit the target right away, you might as well not start. But research shows that 's not true,.
19427 19427 The ( business ) associations have proposed to join hands with the government so that schemes can be extended ( to their units ) and more people brought under them. Such proposals usually do n't come up during pre-budget discussions. It was clear that the industrial firms were facing a tough time because of high inflation and low GDP rate,.
19429 19429 You can imagine that workers who are n't able to work from home are going to be more affected by the shutdown in activity that we 're seeing already. There are things that you can do there,.
19430 19430 The recent fiscal policy actions to increase access to testing and healthcare for those who are sick, to support public and private healthcare providers who are dealing with virus containment and the treatment of ill patients, and to help workers and small businesses that will be most affected by work stoppages are the types of government policy measures that can be most helpful in defending against the adverse consequences of the disease for individuals and the economy,.
19435 19435 For example, a business which used to hire three workers for 40 hours per week, and which during the pandemic only requires 40 hours of labour in total, might then be able to retain each of the three workers for 13 hours per week, rather than needing to lay off two workers and retaining one worker in a full-time position,.
19436 19436 I think he has the best plan and he 's not from Washington,.
19439 19439 There was a sense that 2008 was a show that we had seen before -- the panic of 1907, the Great Depression. We know about financial crises. We knew that it was just money, and that one way or the other the government would step in and save the bankers from their folly.
19441 19441 Anything that suggests downside risks to oil price is a risk to Nigeria,.
19446 19446 We should pursue revolutionary change for government structures, but evolutionary change for society.
19453 19453 If history is anything to go by -- recall the mad cow disease-induced curbs on British beef -- then some of the new export curbs will be in place for years,.
19454 19454 If minimizing uncertainty was the goal, an automatic licensing system would have been introduced EU-wide, as opposed to fragmenting the single market with a hodgepodge of different national implementation procedures.
19457 19457 [ Fox 's ] quarter that ended in December might not be vibrant, but then results should just roar ahead. With all these politicians running for office and gathering money and spending it, this is going to be a tsunami year for TV broadcasters.
19459 19459 Personally I think it 's been a close call, therefore it does n't take much data to swing it one way or the other and the next few [ MPC ] meetings are absolutely live,.
19460 19460 What we have done here today is to bring you a message of hope. But we also challenge you to put in your best as I can assure you that these are the surest ways to your welfare as well.
19465 19465 Thinking about this ahead of time can be very helpful : it can reduce the stress of all the decision making and arrangements required when someone dies, and can help anchor the expense.
19468 19468 We will assess the situation to mitigate and minimize the impacts. We can not eradicate the impacts, but we can minimize them for corporations and the public.
19474 19474 Because if we lift too early, the pandemic can take hold again. And that itself is very bad for the economy.
19476 19476 Hopefully they can hang on until the help gets there, but the help is not going to come overnight.
19477 19477 A lot of families and businesses can know that help is on the way,.
19479 19479 If you read them objectively, these efforts are to safeguard the wellbeing of our community members and to assist those who are at risk or in need.
19484 19484 We should n't hide our veterans' injuries just to pretend like we 're invincible,.
19485 19485 I think we will see a lot of rethinking on this, coming on the back of the trade disruption, now we have this,.
19487 19487 It is, unfortunately, spreading undetected more than initially was thought,.
19491 19491 It appears that the main reason for this slowdown was the non-banking financial institutions experiencing a turbulence,.
19499 19499 Our IMF staff team is working expeditiously to respond to this request so that a proposal can be considered by the Fund 's Executive Board in the coming weeks,.
19504 19504 in the short term, is likely to bring some slowdown,.
19507 19507 So then we can agree on synchronized, or even better, coordinated measures to protect the world economy from a more serious shock,.
19508 19508 very concerned about the negative outlook for global growth in 2020 and in particular about the strain a downturn would have on emerging markets and low-income countries.
19511 19511 The father had once called the BJP ` Deshdrohis'. Wonder what he would be thinking of his son joining that gang ....
19514 19514 The government owes an explanation why a commitment was made that 42 per cent of the devolved tax revenue would go to states has become only 30 per cent. It has never been 42 per cent. I think this is a breach of promise,.
19517 19517 Tech workers, tech companies, are used to work online. They exist in the virtual universe. The Bay Area is more likely to be able to resist a downturn.
19526 19526 We had a pretty solid outlook before this happened -- and there is some risk, but basically I think the U.S. outlook looks pretty good.
19527 19527 Every indication so far suggests there will be a huge plunge in output in the second quarter,.
19535 19535 so missions can continue.
19545 19545 More Europe can not mean Europe alone,.
19546 19546 allowing companies to prepare their own environmental impact statements. We should not be giving self-graded take home exams to polluting companies. And allowing merely 60 days for public comment on these sweeping changes is not nearly enough time to fully consider its broad, far-reaching implications.
19549 19549 There 's going to be more attention on him .... And it should be an overall positive.
19551 19551 If he is saying that we should review the Zupco subsidy and other subsidies, we continue to do these things. We may change it in future, and we may not, but that is normal. I do not think we want to compare one subsidy to another.
19555 19555 If one does n't have much to exchange, one ca n't demand very much, and may thus lose out in competition with others whose needs may be a good deal less acute, but whose entitlements are stronger.
19556 19556 Our intellectual horizons expand when we learn from each other. We can give to the world much more than what we get from it.
19557 19557 Over the last few years, the focus has been on very practical issues, real world challenges that economics can solve,.
19558 19558 It also radically changed how I think about the world.
19559 19559 My fever had spiked up to 102. I was still having body aches, loss of taste. I was really weak. I was having respiratory problems. I could not talk without having shortness of breath,.
19561 19561 operates independently as it should.
19563 19563 The news, in absolute terms of new infections, is likely to get worse.
19566 19566 While great uncertainty remains, it has become clear that our economy will face severe disruptions. Aggressive efforts must be taken across the public and private sectors to limit the losses to jobs and incomes and to promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate,.
19568 19568 we could see a drop of 5 million jobs in April. We are going to see numbers we never thought possible. This will be the biggest economic hit that any developed economy has ever seen outside wartime.
19569 19569 We expected a bigger rebound after last week 's exceptionally low reading, so today 's report adds more weight to our view that the underlying trend in claims is not rising ; it might, perhaps, be falling again,.
19570 19570 If this continues, the epidemic will come under control well before the appearance of warmer, drier weather begins naturally to stem its spread,.
19571 19571 the rise in public-sector debt and destruction of human, and possibly physical, capital is important,.
19577 19577 Interest rates should make it easier for both the public and business sectors to contemplate long-term investments, given that future returns do n't need to be discounted as much,.
19580 19580 If the unemployment rate were to be trending in the wrong direction and there was no further progress being made towards the inflation target, the balance of arguments would change. In those circumstances, the Board would see a stronger case for further monetary easing,.
19589 19589 We see India recovering. There is a significant recovery coming in the next fiscal year. There is a fair amount of monetary stimulus in the system, corporate tax cuts are also there -- these should help with recovery in growth,.
19592 19592 We are better prepared than other countries that have large revenues from oil production, which today have to cut their budgets, he said. We will fully fulfill all obligations. We will not cut or reduce budget adjustments that have been adopted.
19594 19594 Women do the great majority of childcare. Women do the great majority of taking care of elderly parents, including their in-laws. Women do the majority of taking care of their husbands' parent s. If you are in a couple, this is a hard time, but this is a good time for really reaching for a little equality. Lean in at home, gentlemen !.
19595 19595 How do you ensure that relationships with third party groups such as voter registration platforms are reaching the right people who could potentially learn from them the most on Facebook ?.
19599 19599 [ A payroll tax holiday ] might help them in one sense. It might help them in that their employers might be able to carry them on their payrolls, even though, again, I realize that that these are part-time contracting jobs, but they might be able to to come to some arrangements with them to keep money flowing to them without going bust themselves.
19609 19609 Providing financial support to specific industries and companies should be the last thing on the list of fiscal stimulus measures.
19610 19610 The macroeconomic operation of China is generally stable, and the supply and demand is basically balanced, which indicates the country is not prone to long-term inflation or deflation,.
19612 19612 I ask for forgiveness to anyone I may have wronged. To those who wronged me, I forgive you,.
19614 19614 There is no housing or commercial real estate overhand.
19617 19617 This suggests that differences in access -- rather than differences in student interest -- are probably driving gaps in participation.
19620 19620 The one thing with vulnerabilities is that we do see that they have been stabilizing, the housing market is starting to stabilize in different places and we do n't see the froth and we see more savings than we thought we had given historical revisions. That 's important information.
19625 19625 I did n't want one of our characters to have the number of a real victim or a real survivor, as I did not want to misrepresent a real person or borrow from a specific moment in an actual person 's life,.
19630 19630 And as I got older and became a student of the Holocaust and my grandmother 's story, those poppy colors began to desaturate. I began to see the stark, depraved moments of what happened. And I think you 'll see the show toes these different tonal lines that explores the kind of wish-fulfillment, comic book superhero of it all, and then the very sobering, reverential portrayal of life in the camps.
19631 19631 Or if they did, I think we would have to censor a lot of it and cut a lot of it. Jennifer Salke and the whole Amazon team was so vehement in their support of wanting this vision to really come to life as it was written on the page, which just felt like a really lucky thing.
19632 19632 My grandmother was a Holocaust survivor, and she would tell me stories about the war and what she experienced,.
19636 19636 It 's too early to shift the entire macro policy over the virus outbreak, but we may see some micro steps to tide the economy over,.
19638 19638 Once the social-distancing and quarantine measures are relaxed, we should see this temporary pause evaporate, and will have potential buyers return with the same enthusiasm.
19639 19639 I do n't think home prices will fall if there 's a war,.
19642 19642 The rise in the homeownership rate among the younger adults, under 35, and minority households means an increasing number of Americans can build wealth by owning real estate.
19645 19645 Within the next three years, American manufacturers are, for the first time, on track to employ more college graduates than workers with a high school education or less, part of a shift toward automation that has increased factory output, opened the door to more women and reduced prospects for lower-skilled workers.
19647 19647 How on earth would such a drastic change in temperature make such a tiny difference to GDP ?,.
19648 19648 The [ Chinese ] government 's running a trade surplus overall, so it 's got the capacity to purchase more imports without driving itself into a trade deficit which would unravel the insulation that China currently has from international disturbances. But can it consume that much more on top of everything else, or will there be a shift in buying from one country to another ? It may be as well the Chinese are doing the classic ` Yes, we understand what you have said,' rather than ` Yes, we agree to what you have proposed,.
19649 19649 I was terrified because I knew if I went in there that it 's very possible, I 'm going to get it and I have preexisting conditions,.
19650 19650 I 'm hopeful that there is a natural limit to the job loss, because we hit the most obvious sectors first -- the businesses that had to shut down immediately, because they served crowds of people. Most people who do work sitting at a computer can do that anywhere. It 's easier for many in office jobs to continue work as usual.
19657 19657 While PM Rajapaksa is on a whirlwind tour he was accompanied by one of his Ministers ShriThondaman who is a true blue Tamil being a descendant of 19th century Tamil plantation labour from India unlike northern Jaffna Tamils. He is dynamic and can be a bridge,.
19664 19664 There may be some familiar faces but not in the way you think. I love our cameo actresses & actors. I 'm happy they wanted to be a part of it. One of the cameos is gon na make you guys laugh.
19665 19665 The priority given to projects by the relevant NGB ( s ) or local authority was one of the key determinants of the assessment score along with factors such as the likelihood of increasing sport participation, how the proposed project would improve high performance and whether the proposed development would benefit spectators.
19666 19666 I 'd like to thank all those who are providing these essential services so that people who rely on public transport, working in hospitals, pharmacies, the grocery sector, and other vital areas, can continue to get to where they are needed to the benefit of us all.
19668 19668 Our three-year-old daughter wants to know if her daddy is coming back,.
19670 19670 Fiscal policy is planning for the long-run. The whole levelling up agenda should remain a focus.
19671 19671 A hurried fiscal boost we think may be stymied by a lack of current capacity in the economy, or possibly by creating unrealistic short-term expectations about the extent to which that can quickly bring about an acceleration of living standards,.
19677 19677 The first indication I got of any allegation was in January 2018. I did n't pay the friendly warning -- or whatever it was -- any regard, basically, because I had no reason to fear a complaint from ( Woman H ).
19678 19678 I did n't pay the friendly warning -- or whatever it was -- any regard, basically, because I had no reason to fear a complaint from ( Ms H ).
19679 19679 My understanding of why that was is that the First Minister could be ....
19681 19681 So I think we need some direction from the Commonwealth government and from the Fair Work Commission to make sure people are not penalised financially for doing what they are asked to by government.
19685 19685 -700 k is an awful jobs month. That it 's the best news we will get for some time should give us a terrible pit in our stomach.
19686 19686 If there is not sufficient governance and accountability such that worthy small businesses have to shut down, and then we find out that the undeserving high-income small businesses or politically connected businesses are the ones that get the money ... then that will be a credibility disaster for the program,.
19687 19687 The thing that has been buoying the economy and propping us up has been consumer confidence. It 's consumer spending and confidence that has driven the late part of the boom. If that dries up because of the virus, there will be major ramifications.
19689 19689 For generations, Tonka trucks have been the benchmark of durable and rugged toys that let imaginations run wild. We are bringing together these two legendary icons with the common goal of getting kids off their screens and outside or on the floor to enjoy some fun, creative and active play.
19694 19694 The energy choices that India makes will be critical for Indian citizens as well as the future of the planet. This was demonstrated at the IEA 's 2019 Ministerial Meeting, which mandated the Agency to start consultations with India for a strategic partnership that could serve as a path to eventual membership, a game-changer for international energy governance.
19697 19697 It would appear that ASIO has become something of a self-appointed gatekeeper on foreign investment into Australia. None of this would matter very much if the process was transparent, open and contestable, but it is not.
19699 19699 I think people would give you £ 100 million not to fucking make that record, you know what I mean ? They 'd just go ` yeah, look, here 's £ 100 million quid for the tour and here 's another £ 100 million quid to not make a record like that.'.
19701 19701 Noel seems to think he 'll be throwing me a bone, you know what I mean ?.
19702 19702 If you do n't follow anyone, how do you know when Bonehead 's tweeted ?.
19704 19704 The implied path of policy rates over the forecast period generated by the Quarterly Projection Model indicated three repo rate cuts of 25 basis points each in the second and fourth quarter of 2020, as well as in the third quarter of 2021. Monetary policy can ease financial conditions and improve the resilience of households and firms to the short-term economic implications of Covid-19. Our decision and its magnitude seeks to do this in the near term.
19714 19714 a belief that one will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes.
19718 19718 Being able to replicate an existing framework, which can then be tailored according to Indonesian needs and geography, will be beneficial for us.
19721 19721 can explain only part of the loss of property : between a quarter and a third in France and Germany, and at most a few percent in the United Kingdom.
19724 19724 If, however, this is an attempt to politicize the board 's discussion and possibly undermine the chair,.
19725 19725 If the firms go bankrupt, this can be durably destructive,.
19730 19730 The analytics are growing, undoubtedly. And with technology and data coming, I think the skills required for a coach or a scout of course are changing, and many are able to change with the times and combine both that experience -- that old school, if you will -- and new-school abilities to take advantage of whatever else is out there. It really leaves us no choice,.
19732 19732 This will not be the last announcement, as the developments have been extremely dynamic. We will assess the situation to mitigate and minimize the impacts. We can not eradicate the impacts but we can minimize them for corporations and the public,.
19734 19734 As the Governor said there has been no feed-through into economic data at this stage, but the government is actively monitoring the outbreak, and well prepared for any effect it may have on the UK economy,.
19739 19739 I think the Bank will want to wait and take stock, see whether the spread of the virus stabilises, see how long it lasts and measure the impact on supply and demand in the economy.
19744 19744 I remember reading Olson in either the late 1980s or early 1990s and thinking, ` Well, that 's interesting, but it does n't sound like America. We 're a vibrant, open society.'.
19746 19746 Instead of being bargain hunters, we 're going to be thinking about our own safety, while seeking convenience.
19747 19747 Market shifts are forcing beer marketers to think twice about how they have sold beer to Canadians. For example, beer and hockey have always formed a natural, very effective co-branding scheme,.
19748 19748 I would say typically dry goods and frozen foods are typically hot sellers whenever there is some ` panic buying,.
19751 19751 Iran can not live with another year of sanctions destroying its economy. Therefore they have to provoke.
19753 19753 We will definitely see an effect on jobs from the coronavirus, and it could be pretty large in leisure and hospitality,.
19760 19760 I do not think all apparel production is going to be back in the United States,.
19769 19769 commodity markets are spot assets and must clear the surpluses developing today from weak demand and rising supply.
19770 19770 a bullish development, and while stretched, should lead to higher gold prices in the days/week ahead,.
19771 19771 I think you 're going to start to see some real problems beginning to develop.
19772 19772 The range of potential scenarios is very large ; spanning oil supply shocks or even oil demand destruction -- which would be negative to oil prices. In contrast, history shows that under most outcomes gold will likely rally to well beyond current levels,.
19774 19774 Czech government gives tops priority to innovations and small modular reactors can be the future of nuclear energy. I am glad ČEZ has intensive research in this field. Czech nuclear energy research has traditionally been one of the best in the world and the cooperation with GE Hitachi on development of small modular reactors further confirms this position.
19776 19776 The signing of the phase-one deal would represent a welcome, even if modest, de-escalation of trade hostilities between China and the U.S.,.
19777 19777 The stimulus package will comprise of a number of measures. We have to look at the most optimum policy mix that would the support private sector, but at the same time ensure fiscal sustainability of the government continues to be sustained,.
19779 19779 We do not look at the latest growth numbers as an indication of success, but we have to look at how the culture is changing,.
19780 19780 would be one of them.
19781 19781 That authorities are trying to slow down the spread of the virus with unusual, if sometimes crude, measures also contains a kernel of good news : they are taking the issue very seriously,.
19788 19788 But even by the end of next year I think we are still going to be looking at something like a 6 % unemployment rate,.
19790 19790 I think she shows a lack of willingness to show leadership.
19797 19797 exceed everything known in Germany from economic crises or natural disasters in recent decades.
19799 19799 The wait until June for this grant will, however, be an agonising one for many and I would urge the government to do all they can do bring forward this vital support.
19801 19801 Although it 's not the moment now to end the lockdown we need to think about where we are going to be in two, three, four weeks' time and now start looking at that plan,.
19802 19802 There would be more hiring, which would also bring up the wage.
19806 19806 expected states would put forward a variety of candidates ; none would win a national majority in the electoral college ; and the election would typically pass to the House of Representatives.
19807 19807 I was afraid that people would think we wanted to attack their way of life, take their cars, impose eco-taxes and limit their access to consumer products,.
19808 19808 Send everybody who is be in Ridgeland to jail or kill them before February.
19812 19812 She thought she had a common cold or allergies ... it all started with a fever and nasal congestion,.
19816 19816 Canadians are at home, fighting isolation and loneliness. We hope # CanadaPerforms will amplify a movement already started with more and more artists turning to online platforms to find audiences, and provide those artists some much needed financial support until they can get up again on stage in front of a live audience,.
19817 19817 I would guess the U.S. will hit a peak in deaths in the next two-three weeks, as the doubling time seems to be about two-three days,.
19824 19824 Small businesses and medium sized businesses who are less able to handle reduced activity for a time, there are things that can help from the fiscal side there,.
19836 19836 And we need some clear indications that the government is worried about supply chains and how to maintain them.
19839 19839 We could n't justify asking people to put their lives and their families' lives in potential jeopardy so we could keep our sandwich shop open,.
19843 19843 We would go, first, from lockdown to red, where we must still stop doing things we might have done before the crisis. Then to amber, as conditions improve, but we still need to be careful. Eventually, back to green, when medical experts can give the all-clear,.
19844 19844 Netflix has just picked up a new spin-off series and I know there have been chats about possibly doing films about it. And I do think that there 's a lot more story that can be told with this show if it was done the right way. There 's just so much incredible history in the Vikings culture, so who knows ?.
19848 19848 The aspirational growth rate could be between 6.5 per cent to 7 per cent. At this stage it will be difficult to attain nine per cent GDP growth,.
19850 19850 Unless there is another outbreak or something unexpected, given the general trends today, we expect strong and quick recovery of the domestic travel market,.
19852 19852 hard to see how the quantified ( and properly discounted ) economic benefits could in fact exceed the cost.
19853 19853 I think the Fed has been extremely proactive, and Jay Powell and his team have been working really hard and gotten ahead of this and shown they can set up a whole bunch of diverse programs that will help us keep the economy functioning during this shutdown period.
19858 19858 A cyber attack on any of the most active US banks that impairs any of those bank 's ability to send payments would likely be amplified to affect the liquidity of many other banks in the system. The extent of the amplification would be even greater if the banks respond strategically, which they are likely to do if there is uncertainty about the attack.
19860 19860 He is. Well, oh no, I 'm not saying that, I do n't, but -- it 's a fine line, and it 's authoritarianism either way because you just ca n't enforce it unless you put up a whole --.
19862 19862 If one were to strictly go by what the law lays down, there may be a compliance issue and safety risks subject to the grant of completion certificate with regard to these vacant, under-construction projects being converted into quarantine centres,.
19863 19863 Stimulation of technology development of the economy. We should endeavor to make a real breakthrough in digitalization of the real sector,.
19870 19870 He began the meeting with a strange speech about how the United States is not a perfect country, and the people in that room should be ` very mindful of the need for the United States not to always be pointing fingers and lecturing and to be somewhat introspective as we think about these things.'.
19872 19872 Our economic growth in the first quarter is likely to drop to 4.9 percent according to our assessment. That 's not a doomsday scenario but based on the V-shape scenario that we project.
19877 19877 I think one very interesting point is, what will happen to your [ oil & gas ] assets if the price of electricity falls to € 0.02 or € 0.03 per kWh ? And why € 0.02 or € 0.03 per kWh ? Because that 's probably the price that 's required for electricity to make green hydrogen competitive with fossil fuels ; replacing fossil fuels in industry with green hydrogen,.
19878 19878 I went to the court to seek justice for a free and fair election. I can not be dancing here that the court has reinstated me as vice president,.
19881 19881 We need to think about testing capacity, we need to think about capacity for self-isolation and self-quarantine and a number of other things that we need,.
19885 19885 Most Latin American and European countries would be in opposition, and because Maduro has allies like China and Russia, which Noriega never had.
19887 19887 What we are hearing from our contacts is that May is going to loom as a large month, in terms of the transition of concern from this being a liquidity issue -- one where we are really talking about cash flows -- to this perhaps translating and transferring into a solvency issue, and whether companies can exist at all,.
19888 19888 I am thrilled and privileged to be taking on this hugely important role at the BBC at a crucial time. International trade can be dismissed as dry and complex but globalisation has shaped all our fortunes - for better or worse - in recent years. The new decade is going to be defined by radical changes in trading relationships. I 'm looking forward to working with my BBC colleagues to strip away the spin and speculation, to explain to our audiences what lies in store - and exactly what this means for them.
19891 19891 Price or regulate, you do n't have to do either one -- but you got to do at least one.
19893 19893 When you think about the optimal policy, you really want to see the effect between the economy and epidemiology,.
19894 19894 And now the coronavirus has added another layer of very serious concern and I believe the government need to think very carefully what they are going to do.
19895 19895 I think it is on the back burner, frankly. I mean, yes, we 're watching everything play out, but it 's not the first thing on my mind,.
19897 19897 There can be some tweaks, but there is no chance of making this a perfect policy tool,.
19901 19901 We are particularly committed to supporting ECCAS to seamlessly move into the operational phase of the AfCFTA and together with you, we would like to push for the swift ratification of the trade agreement by member States of the subregion who are yet to do so,.
19902 19902 The main reason why we are here is that we are supposed to launch what we are calling at the United Nations a decade of action from 2020 to 2030. We would like that no African is left behind as we try to develop so that there is prosperity for all,.
19905 19905 In the near-term, we expect subscriber growth to come primarily from outside the U.S., with the next meaningful phase of domestic subscriber growth likely to coincide with the release later this calendar year of highly anticipated original content, including episodic series from Marvel and season two of ` The Mandalorian,'.
19914 19914 Congress should subpoena Dr. Doom Fauci 's phone records and see how many times he has called Hillary in the past 60 days,.
19915 19915 could have an effect downward on prices,.
19916 19916 disruptive and mutually reinforcing events. Significant economic pain seems unavoidable in all countries,.
19918 19918 can do a lot better no doubt.
19922 19922 The J-PAL study reinforces earlier evidence that compulsory biometric authentication severely disrupted the PDS in Jharkhand, with dire consequences for many poor households. Unfortunately, none of this evidence seems to affect the central government 's determination to impose this technology across the country.
19929 19929 I think I just have to learn my trade, especially as a centre-half. It is what you do off the ball.
19930 19930 If verified when the data are released, there are at least two plausible explanations for this alarming reversal for India 's poor : the demonetisation and the introduction of the GST. Both transient shocks, but costly.
19931 19931 It must reflect deep pessimistic things in the society.
19932 19932 That is, when each type of facility is designed and constructed, there is a set schedule to keep each dam, road or bridge in a state of good repair,.
19933 19933 Ultimately we do think that the plan announced in October ( $ 60B per month, not-QE program targeting the short end of the curve ) and that we are implementing, will get reserves up to the ample level. Once we get to that point, certainly we would not be expecting to have ongoing large repo operations as necessary.
19935 19935 I think it 's almost better that you do n't have a Jimmer and you 're still successful,.
19938 19938 But this urban happiness advantage evaporates and sometimes turns negative for cities in high-income countries, suggesting that the search for happiness may well be more fruitful when looking to live in more rural areas.
19943 19943 People should n't take it for granted that there is time to connect with them later, particularly older family members,.
19947 19947 Will the government regret that it did n't save money in early 2020 ? Or will it regret that we let a viral infection kill millions of people, which also, by the way, led to the death of a lot of great companies ? It 's pretty obvious what the worst-case scenario is. You want to err on the side of saving lives.
19952 19952 Maybe, some of them thought that it looks as if we are understating the importance of poverty. That is not true. Because I had told myself that ` look, all we are saying is that poverty has fallen. We are not saying that poverty has disappeared'.
19954 19954 doing what it is supposed to do, and that is, have some challenges.
19955 19955 hard to imagine that you would go negative to, say, minus 5 %.
19956 19956 Many of the media publishers felt that this was a really important issue, that if we understood more about how the ad tech market worked and people had much more visibility about where the money went, the value for money that might help news media publishers who have a very clear product against which to advertise,.
19957 19957 If ever there was a time to expedite digital innovation, this is it,.
19965 19965 What is your story of development, progress, social justice ... this is what is required. And there should be absolute honesty and clarity on what you say and what you do .....
19977 19977 This decision, to a large extent, can contribute to ending the international isolation of Sudan and helping to a great extent in the peace and economic recovery,.
19981 19981 Whenever politicians make decisions, whether they are panicked or drunk, the consequences are rarely attractive,.

19987 19987 Would like to thank HRH Sheikh Muhammed Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces for announcing $ 200mn support to Pakistan after meeting with Prime Minister Imran Khan,.
19991 19991 As we deal with it as best we can, we also need to look to the other side when things will recover. When we do get to that other side, all those fundamentals that have made Australia such a successful and prosperous country will still be there,.
19995 19995 I think the period of effectiveness of monetary policy is coming to an end. If you cut another 25 or 50 basis points [ from interest rates ] it 's not going to have much effect on the real economy. But it will egg up asset prices, particularly property prices, which is not a good thing,.
19997 19997 My pal thinks Freddie Mercury 's better looking than you. Tell her she 's wrong,.
20003 20003 The key measuresin the coming weeks will be social distancing, self-isolation, quarantine, shelter in place, and other measures to shut down, deliberately and systematically -- if well done -- key parts of social and economic life,.
20006 20006 Either you shut off the economy now and have people staying at home, or you let this thing rip and you have people staying at home scared,.
20012 20012 Tens of millions of people are going to lose their jobs. In just one example, we have calculated that in the refinery sector and petrol stations alone, around 50 million people are employed, and they 're supporting families totaling 250 million people, and most of them will lose their jobs if it continues like this.
20013 20013 Today, 3 billion people in the world are locked down. As a result of that we may well see sometime throughout this year demand to fall down, as some say, about 20 million barrels per day,.
20015 20015 A large part of these emissions can be brought down relatively quickly and easily,.
20018 20018 Subsidies always work better if they are targeted, if the person who is vulnerable is identified and receives that subsidy directly,.
20019 20019 Last time we met parliamentarians, we spoke about how policies are being missed ` Nicodemously' ... or how they see the light of day without Parliament having agreed to it,.
20027 20027 This last week, very good progress has been made in the discussions with the Ukrainian authorities on the new Extended Fund Facility ( EFF ) arrangement. Adoption of legislation to improve the bank resolution framework and on land reform would allow moving forward quickly with finalizing the parameters of the new arrangement, with larger access than previously envisaged.
20028 20028 For example, coming with the unified tax system, and the demonetisation took place. These are steps that over time are beneficial, but of course they might be somewhat disruptive over short term,.
20031 20031 The coronavirus is our most pressing uncertainty : a global health emergency we did not anticipate in January. It is a stark reminder of how a fragile recovery could be threatened by unforeseen events,.
20040 20040 Netflix Vacation Policy and Tracking : there is no policy or tracking. There is also no clothing policy at Netflix, but no one comes to work naked.
20047 20047 To me, humor is such a powerful weapon. It is an antidote, it is a medicine for people who for so long have felt so persecuted, for generations have felt displaced or otherized in some way. I think Jewish wit and Jewish humor is so inherent in our culture and it 's in part a defense mechanism, so I wanted the experience of the show to mirror all of those things,.
20048 20048 And so to be able to show a Jewish superhero with might, with power, with strength, not just a Jew who is as the media often portrays us, as ineffectual or intellectual only or nebbishy ... that was so important to me.
20049 20049 That was the only way I could try to understand her stories -- her heroism, her boldness, her defiance.
20052 20052 Moreover, they will likely be slow to ramp up their operations, fearful of the implications if they move too quickly and their workers get sick,.
20053 20053 There is a boatload of stimulus coming, and I do think it is big enough to offset the demand shock,.
20054 20054 It wo n't be until the second half of the year, when the virus has presumably passed, that the economy will slowly get back up and running.
20057 20057 Given COVID-19, it is even more questionable. President Trump has suggested that the federal government will cut another check to hard-pressed U.S. farmers to make up for the losses,.
20059 20059 comprehensive and timely package of measures to help U.K. businesses and households bridge across the economic disruption that is likely to be associated with COVID-19.
20063 20063 I ca n't recall the last time we have gone into a BoE monetary policy decision with the market as divided on what the outcome will be. This is certainly not akin to the way in which either the Fed or the ECB like to go into a monetary policy decision,.
20064 20064 an economic shock that could prove sharp and large, but should be temporary.
20065 20065 That changes the negotiating dynamics for Canada. If we 're getting this tariff-free access for a year, do we really want to negotiate for it ?.
20068 20068 the creation of a CBDC poses a number of opportunities, it could raise significant challenges for maintaining monetary and financial stability.
20075 20075 You may have to reach difficult decisions to change or even cancel plans to ensure your own well-being and timely return to Madison.
20078 20078 If you run into a system that is conspicuously malfunctioning and raises questions about the reliability and credibility of the system, this is not only going to impact the sustainability of the growth but also equally the capacity to attract significant amount of foreign investment.
20080 20080 Lets see if the new government wants to engage with the international sector.
20082 20082 Part of the goal now is to offer the kind of lending and making sure the financial markets stay liquid and making sure they stay on a firm foundation and then bridging people from the economy, which in February looked very good ... so that when we get to the other side of this ... the economy and economic activity can come back,.
20084 20084 If people are temporarily staying home, not traveling, not interacting and purchasing things, that could be a short-term hit,.
20085 20085 But you need to have some kind of evidence that, if you 've changed your outlook, why have you changed your outlook.
20086 20086 I never thought of myself as a hawk. I thought of myself as trying to balance risk over a longer horizon.
20090 20090 The virus ca n't survive long on seats or armrests, so physical contact with another person carries the greatest risk of infection on a flight,.
20092 20092 There 's thousands and thousands of people who are putting solar panels on their home in the United States, so they seem to think it 's a good idea, but yet there 's still millions and millions of people like me who do n't have solar panels,.
20096 20096 If there 's full-scale war, there 's regime change not in Iran but in the U.S.,.
20105 20105 We can spend funds of the National Wealth Fund on such payback projects already this year, as the President stressed in his Address to the Federal Assembly, this year,.
20107 20107 dysfunctional Thanksgiving dinner, or something, where you come in and everybody knows what everybody else has got to say.
20109 20109 Let me flip it the other way, a test at a point in time is just that, it 's a test in a point in time, it may actually reinforce behaviours that we do n't wish to see reinforced over social distancing, i.e people not following the advice, if they go along have a test and then are reassured it is all fine. I think there is a very real risk of that.
20112 20112 ... I also wanted to be able to work as much as I can handle right now, with everything that 's going on at home. And I wanted to figure out a way that I could do both those things.
20113 20113 OK but hear me out in this scene i guess she is trying to say that there nothing new if a woman take cares and nourishes her child but when a man does that he is extraordinary and the greatest dad,.
20117 20117 It is already clear that the answer must involve a significant increase in public debt. The loss of income incurred by the private sector -- and any debt raised to fill the gap -- must eventually be absorbed, wholly or in part, on to government balance sheets. Much higher public debt levels will become a permanent feature of our economies and will be accompanied by private debt cancellation.
20118 20118 Banks must rapidly lend funds at zero cost to companies prepared to save jobs,.
20122 20122 Due to Covid-19, India 's GDP growth rate will take a hit and may come down to 2.1 per cent from 4.5 per cent ... India should release an economic package which should not be less than 5 per cent of its GDP soon,.
20124 20124 is key for the development of every economy and we believe that if we can all work together and improve power, it will propel growth in our country seriously.
20125 20125 The biggest economic hit on a monthly basis will likely be in the month of April,.
20128 20128 The world needs a healthy recovery. It needs a strong recovery. And that will not come about if the world de-globalizes because that would severely reduce productivity in the world,.
20129 20129 However this recovery is not guaranteed. This could be worse if the pandemic lasts longer,.
20130 20130 The output loss associated with this health emergency and related containment measures likely dwarfs the losses that triggered the global financial crisis,.
20132 20132 Broad-based fiscal stimulus can help boost aggregate demand but would be more effective once business operations begin to normalise,.
20133 20133 We expect a broad-based sharp decline in output in March that will likely worsen in April and May as authorities take ever more restrictive steps to contain the spread of COVID-19. As our base case, we now assume drops in quarterly GDP [ gross domestic product ] by 2.0 % qoq [ quarter-on-quarter ] in the Eurozone and by 1.1 % in the UK,.
20134 20134 The Italian measures -- and the possibility that other parts of Europe may move in the same direction in coming weeks -- are likely to weigh significantly further on confidence in the near term,.
20136 20136 At least for the months March to May, the drop in economic output in much of Europe is likely to exceed that seen from September 2008 to April 2009, possibly by a significant margin,.
20145 20145 I think you could criticise the government here for being a little slow in beginning the process of cleaning up of the bank Non-Performing Assets ( NPAs ). The problem was known actually by 2013 ....
20147 20147 Is n't it true that depositions of the three witnesses in the Clinton trial were completed in only one day each ? And is n't it true that the Chief Justice as presiding officer in this trial has the authority to resolve any claims of privilege or other witness issues without any delay.
20149 20149 Capitalizing on this opportunity to open a new and substantial market for United States poultry exports would greatly benefit domestic businesses while maintaining food safety standards supported by sound science.
20151 20151 I asked them to pray for wisdom for us, to have the knowledge on what is the right thing to do. And I asked them to pray that ... we would have the courage to do what we know to be right.
20153 20153 would have brought any economy, weak or strong, to its knees,.
20154 20154 So we need to get out substantial additional aid to the states to make sure that does n't happen, that would massively delay the recovery.
20157 20157 If the whole south collapses, the rich north ceases to exist,.
20159 20159 That 's a heavy, heavy lift ... [ But ] if we do n't do it, then we have to wait for something to break very badly before we make a change. I 'm hoping we can get there before things break very badly.
20165 20165 We 've got to look through these numbers, look through the tragedy of the next few weeks, think about how we 're going to restart our lives, think about how we 're going to deal with the new normal and think about how we 're going to restart America.
20166 20166 We 've got a curveball with this coronavirus. I think that 's a big deal. If you look at what happened in 2003, estimates ranged 0.5 % to 2 % in GDP for China, half a percent for Southeast Asia,.
20167 20167 You should n't be able to make money this easy,.
20171 20171 Democracy is harder to manage but if done well during times of crisis, it becomes a source of great strength,.
20173 20173 Global growth is likely to be impacted in a meaningful way due to fears of the coronavirus,.
20177 20177 The trade war hit to business capex and especially the imposition of tariffs on an array of Chinese consumer goods on September 1 are likely to blame for the import collapse,.
20178 20178 Very bad, but worse to come. Further big drops are likely in April, because lockdowns began to bite hard only in mid-March, so roughly half the month was largely unaffected by the virus crisis,.
20179 20179 It 's like a vicious cycle. Then, in adulthood, people living in the Ville are much more likely to be diagnosed with asthma, obesity or diabetes, which are all major risk factors in this pandemic.
20182 20182 I hope that once we have a government, it can start addressing these fields,.
20185 20185 You do n't think about a sudden dropoff in people driving, airlines flying and even truck driving.
20191 20191 She is saying this is something the GST Council is deciding. That 's a collective body led by the Centre. The honourable Finance Minister chairs the GST Council. So she can not put it on somebody else,.
20192 20192 ... even if he consistently unplugs his charger for a year, the resulting reduction in carbon-dioxide emissions will be equivalent to less than one-half of one-thousandth of the average person 's annual CO2 emissions in the United Kingdom,.
20193 20193 If our estimate of inflation and the economic situation require [ it ], the key rate may be set beneath the lower bound of the neutral range. This will mean [ a ] loose monetary policy.
20197 20197 if you have a lot of aircraft carriers, you do n't hold them back.
20198 20198 But of course there is going to be a sharp slowdown. It 's really hard to imagine there wo n't be. I think the rest of the world is going to be worse.
20199 20199 We have a lot of examples of the presumed criminality of black men in general. And then we have the advice to go out in public in something that ... can certainly be read as being criminal or nefarious, particularly when applied to black men.
20200 20200 And it 's going to get worse before it gets better. But it 's not fair. And that 's what I think should be urgently at the top of the agenda of the policymakers from coal country, and they 're not, in my opinion.
20203 20203 I congratulate Somalia for embracing important reforms that can do much to encourage sustainable poverty reduction, and I thank our international partners who have worked with us to bring Somalia to this important stage. We are glad to have worked closely with the Federal Government of Somalia in assisting their progress over the past few years and look forward to opportunities for greater World Bank Group support for the Somali people.
20208 20208 In a year or two we should be in a significantly better position.
20209 20209 In that case, other measures to increase policy space, including raising the inflation target, might be necessary,.
20210 20210 if all goes well, in a year or two, we should be in a substantially better position.
20212 20212 There 's a complicated web of interactions we do n't often think about that 's all part of the food-supply chain : truckers, rail cars, shipping, plant workers,.
20213 20213 During the fourth quarter, the five largest stocks in the S & P 500 ( Facebook FB, -0.14 %, Amazon AMZN, +0.67 %, Apple AAPL, +1.45 %, Microsoft MSFT, +0.30 %, Google owner Alphabet GOOGL, +0.36 % ) posted an average earnings surprise of +20 %, compared with just 4 % for the average S & P 500 company. Any weakness to these and other companies would likely push earnings estimates lower,.
20214 20214 the impact of the coronavirus on earnings may well be under-estimated in current stock prices, suggesting that the risks of correction are high.
20215 20215 I am fortunate to be able to grasp this complexity through my permanent encounters, and my added value for my discussion partners is that I can serve as a source for them.
20216 20216 I think both voices are necessary,.
20221 20221 Leading the wind industry is not enough to combat the global challenges we face today. If we are to spearhead the energy transition, we must be an example for doing so in the most sustainable way, and this involves making sustainability part of everything we do.
20222 20222 On the one side, there needs to be climate adaptation efforts, such as relocating people from highly exposed coastal regions or building better disaster preparedness that would withstand extreme hurricanes,.
20224 20224 Trump and the Republicans in Congress can not be trusted to protect the Social Security trust fund,.
20227 20227 I think there 's good reason to be optimistic,.
20228 20228 I think we have a little work to do to get to the conclusion that a high bar for intervention is necessary.
20234 20234 Everything about this year seems to be turning out unusual. When we do hold commencement for the Harvard Class of 2020, I sincerely hope it will also be unusual, but only because it will be among the most joyous commencements in the history of the University.
20237 20237 And so we 've gotten people to understand that it 's there and to want it. But we have n't really given them the tools that it would take to make it easy for them to claim it.
20240 20240 I think that you would only change what we have in legislation if a very strong case could be made that Australia would be better off with the change,.
20241 20241 I think we can all agree we will face more severe events with potential significant losses for somebody,.
20242 20242 If they lay off workers with hard-to-find skills, they may not be able to replace them as the economy improves,.
20243 20243 It is too early to conclude right now whether the world has entered a financial crisis.
20244 20244 Many people I have been interviewing are now working in their bedrooms or shared common rooms, with noise from their partners, family or roommates,.
20246 20246 Bloom expected the positives and negatives to offset each other. But he was wrong. Instead, the robust, nearly two-year study showed an astounding productivity boost among the telecommuters equivalent to a full day 's work. Turns out work-from-home employees work a true full-shift ( or more ) versus being late to the office or leaving early multiple times a week and found it less distracting and easier to concentrate at home.
20248 20248 BI will only act if the market can not fully absorb the papers,.
20251 20251 We are looking into what more we can do. I will not speculate about the outcome but I will say that I think NATO has the potential to do more,.
20257 20257 the best way NATO can support the peace process is to stay committed to our train, assist and advise mission in Afghanistan.
20261 20261 Effective river basin management and water policy formulation requires access to reliable and up-to-date data in easy-to-understand formats for timely decision making. We at Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering ( PME ) at University of Chicago and Tata Centre for Development envisioned the Water-to-Cloud ( W2C ) system for high-resolution spatial and temporal monitoring to gain insights that may be missed with the traditional grab sampling approach. These geo-tagged and time-stamped data can help identify pollution hotspots as well as provide data on violators and efficacy of government sanitation interventions,.
20264 20264 The Bank of Canada meets next Wednesday, and clearly, their press release will address these issues. It 's unlikely the bank will cut rates in response on March 4, but if the economic disruption continues, rate cuts could be coming by mid-year.
20274 20274 I think the bottom line is that when this is all said and done, the size of the U.S. government will be much bigger,.
20277 20277 This is not rocket science. With help even poorer countries can do it.
20279 20279 Estimates that better establish causality find no effect, or a small negative effect. This is my fourth analysis using a fourth methodology and a fourth dataset on actual outcomes that finds no violent effects from video games.
20280 20280 Of course, boat owners should only go out to their moored craft when it is safe to do so.
20281 20281 And that 's what people are doing ; they are fleeing with their bitcoin, whether this is in China, Lebanon or all over the world.
20288 20288 It 's appropriate for people to have some food in the freezer. It 's sound and rational to have three days of inventory at any time for example. But we should n't be overdoing it.
20295 20295 A substantial part of that expenditure could be used as seed capital for DFIs.
20296 20296 The presence of the Chinese companies in our telecommunications networks would compromise our national security,.
20297 20297 The government of any colour can not change this,.
20299 20299 The less good news is that demand is still outpacing supply. The open positions are an indication of both the shortage and the growing demand.
20300 20300 We are looking to see the extent to which weakness from manufacturing may be spreading to services, employment, consumer spending or housing,.
20302 20302 It should help stabilize housing as opposed to pour extra fuel on a hot housing market,.
20303 20303 With great respect, if this is something council wants to do, let 's do it and move on.
20308 20308 In the immediate context, we need to find the necessary supply wherever we can find, even if we have to cajole or push. Since every country is trying to do that, we need to use every way we can to apply pressure and bring-in all that we need,.
20309 20309 The RBI should consider imposing a moratorium on financial institution dividend payments so that they build capital reserves,.
20314 20314 I do n't think anybody 's going on a cruise ship anytime soon until all surfaces are covered in copper.
20318 20318 The $ 3k level may be a bit of an over-retraction and, as such, we are looking for support in the $ 4.5 k neighborhood if pressure continues,.
20319 20319 For BBB-rated companies, if those bond markets start collapsing, they 're not going to have access to credit, and if they get downgraded [ to junk credit status ],.
20324 20324 We 're currently traveling at 180 km/h towards a traffic jam. The only thing that can be done is to hit the brakes. And then we 'll see if we can pull over in time, or at least not crash into it.
20329 20329 It shows that Italy alone is supposed to make as much effort as the EU as a whole.
20335 20335 I can dance but there was no one better on the dance floor than Eddie Albert,.
20339 20339 Probably in the next month or so, we 're going to get together as an organization and just discuss things.
20344 20344 help us take our employer strategy and branding to the next level. We 're the only independent streaming challenger in the game. Our competitors are big and have deep pockets. It 's a tough business landscape, but we can succeed by giving our people a framework that balances creativity, freedom and accountability.
20350 20350 It 's right that we do so in these circumstances but the Government must also recognise that it is not the ideal circumstances and to rush through legislation in a breathless way and to be honest, actually there have been many warnings that this was coming down the track.
20351 20351 There are people in the shadow cabinet who see me having been in the last Labour government as a real problem. I think it 's something we should be proud of. There were a lot of things the last Labour government did wrong but there were a lot of amazing things.
20352 20352 The authorities can not make such last-minute changes. There is no opposition to the regulation per se, but this should be applicable for the new batch so they can consider this while confirming their admission in the first year itself.
20353 20353 The Russians are actively targeting all of their enemies in all different countries -- they have huge resources and Davos is an important place, and this is the one place I can come and personally challenge Russian officials over the murder of Sergei Magnitsky,.
20357 20357 We have heard Okezie Ikpeazu call on us to bring our ideas and join him to develop Abia. We would have been very happy if the governor was ready to accept and implement noble ideas, but very sadly, he does n't, hence his statement is a comical adumbration to hoodwink the gullible into thinking that he is sincerely reaching out and ready to work with those who do n't agree with him.
20359 20359 A rise in temperature means more pests -- and a greater likelihood of periods both of flooding and drought. Rice production must adapt to climate change. Most farmers we talk to do n't talk in terms of climate change -- instead they talk of the monsoons becoming less reliable.
20361 20361 It will be interesting to note what will happen in the upcoming months ... whether there will be investors trying to take advantage of the market turbulence, or first-time homebuyers beginning to move in with very low mortgage rate conditions, or even distressed property sales,.
20364 20364 Our findings suggest that isoprene emissions can be diminished without affecting biomass production in temperate forest plantations.
20365 20365 The costs are likely to exceed anything Germany has experienced in recent decades as a result of economic crises or natural disasters,.
20366 20366 Unfortunately, many virologists are saying the outbreak could subside in the summer, but return in the fall. In that case, a recession would be unavoidable.
20370 20370 More debt has enabled more growth, and even if you have a bit more volatility, it 's still net positive for the economy.
20371 20371 The current global situation is unlike anything we have observed since the end of WWII and promises to surpass the effects of the global financial crisis in 2008 if it continues for any significant length of time,.
20372 20372 We can concentrate on particular jurisdictions according to the circumstances,.
20373 20373 we 'll probably see up to 1.8 million job losses due to stand downs,.
20376 20376 Fiscal resources should not be devoted to favouring a small share of the population, who are by no means among the most deserving. In fact, structurally, India should be thinking of ways to bring more taxpayers into the income tax net. It should not be raising exemption limits, as was done unfortunately in the 2019-20 budget.
20378 20378 the Soleimani incident might suggest the standard North Korean approach of breaking sanctions through brinkmanship might be received less well in Washington by this administration than others the Kim family regime has contended with in the past.
20379 20379 There is a lot of flexibility for people who are in between jobs or anybody looking to make additional income,.
20383 20383 If the government is not providing basic facilities to companies, how is it going to boost the IT sector here ?.
20385 20385 It 's simple subtraction. Even your dog can do it. It represents the number of points the team would be expected to outscore the average D-I team over 100 possessions and it has the advantage of being a linear measure. The difference between +31 and +28 is the same as the difference between +4 and +1. It 's three points per 100 possessions which is much easier to interpret. This measure also makes the SOS and average conference strength numbers less mysterious.
20386 20386 We' re only likely to see this strategy implemented by a coach who is n't concerned about his reputation. However, it 's a strategy that can be useful, especially for underdogs who figure to struggle in five more minutes of action.
20387 20387 We should temporarily defer the debt owed to multilateral development banks and international financial institutions. This can be done by reprofiling loans to create fiscal space for countries to deal with this crisis.
20392 20392 As a whole, we do n't think there has been much positive effect.
20397 20397 The real question is whether the delay of the swing bridge will delay the start of the stationary bridge. The city of Ottawa will have to assess what would happen if they were both out of commission.
20401 20401 We 'll do everything we can to keep people connected while prioritising our support for critical public services, vulnerable customers and those without a working line.
20404 20404 He clearly has fallen out with the MSS one way or another.
20411 20411 Based on that -- and if you remember that the last big downturn that we had was in 2008 -- well then we are overdue,.
20412 20412 I did try. I made a proposal ( in an NSC meeting on January 15 ) to release the survey but I did n't find support. I did put in the proposal as chairman but it did n't get through. I can not say anything more now.
20415 20415 Limiting the ` burn' for now probably makes sense.
20418 20418 And then we see today 's report and that 's not showing up. Where that can be reconciled by one simple, really simple fact : The very bottom has been getting increases for minimum wage increases, not from the market.
20421 20421 the problem for the nation is not that we can not defeat the coronavirus, but that the already crisis-ridden economy has been shattered by the lockdown.
20427 20427 Indeed, it is found internationally that a PCR, being a non-profit enterprise, is able to ensure much better data coverage than PCBs. In turn, the PCBs when given access to comprehensive data from a PCR can provide better and greater value addition through data analytics and innovations, complementing the PCR.
20428 20428 Iran attacks where it sees vulnerabilities, and it exercises restraint when it thinks there could be major consequences,.
20432 20432 Ms. Nora, you have thousands of followers some of whom might be foreigners. I think it 's wise to remove this tweet so it 's not attributed to us as a scientific fail, especially that the whole world is following up with this health concern and may not be aware of our politics. Regards.
20433 20433 The shock would have to be big enough -- and the likelihood of future shocks big enough -- that you would want to change your production structure. And it 's not clear that it is at this point,.
20436 20436 Among Iran 's radicals, there is an obsession with not giving ammunition to the enemy and avoiding appearing weak,.
20437 20437 Basically they do n't want a kind of auction despite the auction may give higher revenue to the government,.
20439 20439 if everyone else is doing it, why should n't I, it 's only fair.
20441 20441 What 's good for the world is if China creates demand for the world.
20447 20447 If ` Inglourious Basterds' is one end of the spectrum, and ` Munich' is the other end of the spectrum, I think ` Hunters' lives in the middle,.
20450 20450 I have at least five seasons' worth of ideas of where I see the series going, and I certainly know the ending of the series. I 'd love to work on a season two, and I 'm hopeful Amazon thinks so, too.
20452 20452 Trade peace is what we should be looking for.
20453 20453 We are looking at doing what we can to be helpful to Argentina. We see eye to eye on the need to restore the economy and to address the increase in poverty that has affected negatively many Argentinians.
20458 20458 What we can do is refer to the similar case of the SARS epidemic and what happened then,.
20460 20460 should continue and expand these efforts to reach the most affected people and businesses -- with policies including increased paid sick leave and targeted tax relief,.
20463 20463 The IMF, in collaboration with the World Bank, is identifying key areas where access to opportunities can be increased, in particular, investing in high-quality education, R & D, and digitalization,.
20465 20465 We do project a recovery in 2021. In fact, there may be a sizeable rebound but only if we succeed in containing the virus everywhere and prevent liquidity problems from becoming a solvency issue,.
20472 20472 Our long-term response must tackle habitat and biodiversity loss,.
20475 20475 This is something that countries ca n't actually argue about. It is a major issue. They have to step up and they should display all the political will that 's needed to get the job done.
20477 20477 Improvements in payment technology may have lowered the cost of switching from cash to digital payments, but there is little evidence they have done much to reduce the expense of moving among currencies,.
20480 20480 AFG and Connective operate in an already concentrated market, and not many other mortgage aggregators offer a similar level or type of service,.
20485 20485 I think what Mr. Buffett realized in 1969 is that being a long-term investor with short-dated capital is just ultimately going to lead to a bad outcome at some point in time,.
20486 20486 [ Coronavirus ] cases appear to be peaking in [ New York ]. Almost the entire country is in shutdown.
20490 20490 In an environment where interest rates are very low -- yesterday the government 's borrowing costs for 10 years were essentially the lowest they 've been since Federation -- are there investments that the government could make or could encourage the private sector to make that would yield risk-adjusted rates of return greater than the lowest interest rates on record ?.
20493 20493 The central scenario is for the Australian economy to grow by around 2 3/4 per cent this year and 3 per cent next year, which would be a step up from the growth rates over the past two years,.
20495 20495 The Reserve Bank will also continue to provide liquidity to Australian financial markets by conducting one-month and three-month repo operations in its daily market operations until further notice. In addition, the Bank will conduct longer-term repo operations of six-month maturity or longer at least weekly, as long as market conditions warrant. The various elements of this package reinforce one another and will help to lower funding costs across the economy and support the provision of credit, especially to small and medium-sized businesses.
20497 20497 We have fantastic opportunities there to reshape our energy production system. Investment is taking place, but it would be enhanced by greater policy certainty.
20501 20501 I think someone has still someone else 's tunes to promote,.
20502 20502 I 'm self-isolating because I think if we are all responsible for a small amount of time we can definitely come back from this,.
20503 20503 He 's told me to tell yous ( sic ), if yous ( sic ) leave with any of his b * * * * es, he 'll have you shot. Like that alright.
20507 20507 could trigger severe economic, financial, political, and geopolitical disturbances unlike anything since the 2008 crisis.
20508 20508 As we have seen, even in cases in which presidents have sought and received Congressional authorization to go to war, the justifications provided have often been faulty, or outright dishonest,.
20510 20510 We should not have to choose between energy efficiency and phasing out HFC 's,.
20512 20512 If we could find common ground [ on the first two bills ], and just use that spirit of consultation and cooperation, we 'll get through this.
20513 20513 What do you think of Speaker Pelosi tearing up the speech at the end ?.
20514 20514 The Trump administration has weakened several environmental and safety rules that protect workers -- again, leaving the Chemical Safety Board as the sole voice providing recommendations to industry that could help protect workers and communities,.
20515 20515 This resolution shines a light on Mr. Redding 's incredible life, and reminds us that his significant contributions to our state and our nation must never be forgotten. I am pleased to join Senator Coons and Congresswoman Blunt Rochester to introduce this resolution honoring Mr. Redding and the positive impact his work continues to have in Delaware and across the nation.
20517 20517 It 's the hardest piece, so we should n't be surprised.
20518 20518 We can not, once again, stumble into an endless war in the Middle East that puts American lives at risk,.
20523 20523 constantly looking into what more they can do to provide further support for Turkey.
20525 20525 We are not leaving Afghanistan but we are prepared to adjust our force level if the Taliban demonstrates the will and the capability to reduce violence and make real compromises that could pave the way for negotiations among Afghans for sustainable peace,.
20527 20527 And we 'll also certainly bring in, as you know, China. And we may bring them in later, or we may bring them in now.
20528 20528 agreed NATO could contribute more to regional security and the fight against international terrorism.
20535 20535 sustained bear market does not look likely.
20540 20540 With the world at such critical crossroads, this year we must develop a ` Davos Manifesto 2020' to reimagine the purpose and scorecards for companies and governments,.
20544 20544 collapsed into what I would describe as a sleepy cuddle.
20551 20551 We remain firmly of the view that a sustained market recovery can not begin until the number of new cases clearly has peaked, but that 's probably several weeks away,.
20556 20556 UK case growth probably has peaked too, along with deaths. The next week or so should bring a clear downturn in both, but the UK is a least a couple of weeks behind the best performing continental European countries,.
20557 20557 This ca n't last ; we expect a rebound over the next few months, likely starting in February,.
20558 20558 If ever there was a case when quick government action could do that, then this is it.
20559 20559 When they step inside the barracks and think about the fact that there was no insulation -- it gets up to 114 degrees here in the summer. It might cool down to about 85 at night, but inside those barracks it was still close to 90. Try to sleep in that.
20564 20564 At that time, we will need a board that will encourage, not discourage, potential bids, and who will allow shareholders to decide whether or not to accept them,.
20571 20571 It 's really hard when they do n't really know what action to take. It 's like taking a bucket to extinguish a fire and not knowing if the bucket is full of water or confetti.
20573 20573 All public schools where displaced learners from Region 4-A ( Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon ) will seek to be accommodated are directed to accept these emergency transferees even with the unavailability or insufficiency of the required transfer credentials,.
20574 20574 If we introduce reforms, it will not necessarily be because we want to raise our rankings in PISA, it is because we care about the future of our 27.2 million learners and the future of this country. We should not fall into a trap of implementing special programs in order to [ just ] rank highly,.
20577 20577 Parents may not be key workers but they will be key workers in their homes because they 're the ones who are paying the mortgage, the rent and the bills. So if parents ca n't go out to work because their children ca n't go to school, who will pay their salaries ?.
20584 20584 Obama had an extraordinary team and so did Bush. There were great men that rose to the occasion. The current Fed team in place is very strong, but they 're not central to response here. They can help at the margins.
20587 20587 We need to understand how the historical institutions influenced economic incentives and activities initially, and how these initial effects may or may not have persisted moving forward.
20592 20592 By implementing this new bylaw, it 's our hope that our City will help Ontario and Canada slow the spread of COVID-19. We all need to take this seriously now for the health of our families, our friends and our community. If you have to go out for essential needs, only send one member of the household, stay apart and be safe.
20593 20593 I could tell by the tone of voice that something was quite different and quite wrong,.
20596 20596 I think it 's so cool that we live here.
20599 20599 If people do n't buy bonds, and hold cash effectively at zero, then it 's really difficult for corporations to get finance. So, there is no new investment and growth slows like Japan.
20604 20604 We could map that changing behaviour into a change in preferences in the consumers' spending patterns, so they would cut back spending in certain areas,.
20605 20605 We kind of limit it to one shower at a time actually, because if you get two people taking a shower -- even in a three thousand square foot home -- there 's not that much pressure to go around,.
20609 20609 I do n't think I 'm alone amongst central bankers -- we do n't like the idea that much,.
20612 20612 But it hinges on how the data evolve from here because ... we have a strong belief that this will prove temporary, but temporary could be longer or shorter,.
20613 20613 I would be in favor of asking banks to suspend dividends and stock buybacks,.
20615 20615 That 's certainly something we can be thinking about [ doing ],.
20618 20618 All in all, it seems Singapore is being more proactive,.
20621 20621 Spring months could still be quite tough for buyers since it takes time to convert housing starts into actual housing completions,.
20623 20623 In universities like JNU we should have not only police but CRPF and BSF too,.
20626 20626 I have welcomed the MPs' pay cut by 30 % for a year. I also think the Rs.25, 000 crores new Parliament building construction should be postponed for a year too.
20628 20628 For UNJ there should be not only the Delhi police, but also a BSF and CRPF camp.
20630 20630 With the relatively limited space to cut the bank rate, if evidence builds that the weakness in activity could persist, risk management considerations would favour a relatively prompt response,.
20634 20634 While the details of Mr. Carney 's vision are still vague, the new financial regulations will likely have a disproportionate impact on private fossil-fuel companies over state-owned entities.
20636 20636 Such a forward-looking measure can help asset owners and asset managers understand the transition pathways of their investments and develop strategies to align financial flows with the necessary transition to net zero,.
20645 20645 The PLA is bringing online weapons platforms of increasing sophistication. Operating the combat systems that underpin these platforms will require enlisted soldiers to be reasonably well educated even before they begin the PLA 's basic training. Given China 's massive educational disparities between regions, it is unclear whether or not the PLA can recruit enlisted personnel at scale without compromising on educational standards.
20646 20646 The challenges facing the PLA 's ability to recruit and retain talent are not necessarily to do with its human resource management, but with pressures on China 's labour force at large. China 's demographic profile is deteriorating rapidly, which is likely to make recruitment of talent a pressing issue for all sectors of the Chinese economy. As China 's labour force shrinks but becomes better educated, the PLA must compete with the private and public sectors to position itself as providing a viable, fulfilling career so that it can attract the best talent from Chinese society.
20647 20647 Today 's announcement is, however, still a tightening of liquidity, and near-term, we would expect market interest rates to adjust to this,.
20649 20649 We never thought that police would attack us. I am preparing for UPSC and was in the library since morning with my laptop. In the evening, we could hear a commotion but never thought we would be attacked since we had nothing to do with the protests.
20652 20652 As soon as financial monitors find us weak, we might plunge into further trouble. We must remain financially sustainable for the time being,.
20653 20653 can ill-afford a full-blown war w / the US while facing onerous economic sanctions and internal tumult, especially w/o Soleimani.
20657 20657 As of this morning 's figures, the total U.S. trade deficit is heading for its first year-over-year decline since 2013, when U.S. growth was a good deal lower than what 's likely for this year,.
20660 20660 It only considers the unemployed. But an awful lot of jobs are filled by people who are out of the labor force or who are changing jobs.
20661 20661 PCBs ( private credit bureaus ) can be legislatively authorised to receive credit data ; however, being for-profit enterprises, they may focus primarily on those data segments around which it is most profitable to build a business model ( for example, provision of credit scores based on data gathered ),.
20662 20662 there would be sufficient successes that you could justify it even if only half were successful.
20663 20663 In general, I think the bigger impact for a smaller city is likely to be if there is already some pre-existing activity to build on, and if there is some reason to think that the area might be attractive otherwise,.
20665 20665 We do n't know if it was speeding, distracted driving or some type of intoxication was the factor,.
20670 20670 There is not one single indicator that would trigger a material change to the US economic outlook.
20675 20675 Even though a lot of people complain about it. But if you look at international comparisons, gasoline prices in Canada are actually at the low end of the spectrum.
20676 20676 Whereas 10-15 years ago, if you had a degree and wanted a full-time job, you 're pretty likely to get that straight away, now it 's about a quarter of people who get a graduate degree, three months after they graduate are doing part-time work, and it 's taking them several years to get the full-time job they want.
20678 20678 A flatter epidemic curve, or healthcare curve, implies a deeper recession,.
20681 20681 If things were going well, those opioids may land on soil that 's not very fertile,.
20683 20683 I certainly would say that I think everyone should be covered. But what 's really killing us is the fact that costs are now so high that it 's eating our economy from the inside out. And the people who are paying the price for that are people with less education.
20686 20686 Sky, which is running its own anti-climate agenda, has been using him as a show pony. They can feed him lines and get him to say things.
20692 20692 With India 's population in 2030 estimated to be 1.5 billion, a GDP of $ 7.1 trillion would translate into an annual per capita GDP of $ 4,730 in 2017-18 constant dollars. This figure would still be far from the per capita GDP of developed countries, but enough to virtually eliminate abject poverty from India ....
20693 20693 Employers should do as much as they can to avoid cutting people with mission-critical skill,.
20694 20694 If that happens you 're looking at one of the biggest negative jobs numbers that we 've ever seen,.
20695 20695 We have got a really big negative shock coming but we would also know pretty well when it 's behind us,.
20706 20706 All these taboos were made to preserve our environment. We ignored these taboos and now our water bodies are dying. We can not find clean water in Ghana now, because of galamsey.
20709 20709 If the proposal drops tomorrow, they [ Labor ] could have a 60-day comment period and have enough time to write the final [ rule ] by the end of the year. But it would have to happen quickly.
20724 20724 At the same time, to reassure investors, the government could express its commitment to return to fiscal rectitude, backing up its intent by accepting the setting up of an independent fiscal council and setting a medium-term debt target, as suggested by the N K Singh committee.
20727 20727 our little hospital would n't cope.
20728 20728 You wo n't necessarily have big government programs, but you could have extensive intervention.
20730 20730 I 'm worried about the possibility that the recovery might be slower in the U.S. than in European countries or in Canada, for instance.
20737 20737 The Governing Council must not lose sight of the exit from loose monetary policy,.
20738 20738 the improvement is probably a direct consequence of social distancing and the plunge in economic activity, and could reverse quickly if people just went back to work.
20739 20739 The initial improvement was mostly policy-driven, but the greater optimism of the past week seems to be at least partly related to the virus itself. To be clear, the health situation remains very bad in absolute terms, especially in the U.S. which is now ahead of Italy and Spain in terms of coronavirus-related fatalities ( though still much lower on a per-capita basis ). However, the number of new active cases looks to be peaking globally.
20741 20741 This has the effect of disqualifying the Attorney General from continuing to represent the Electoral Commission in this proceeding, whether before this Court or indeed in any other proceeding,.
20743 20743 Together, with the support of the allied sports-entertainment community, we plan to personally hand deliver not only devices, but hope to as many children as we can.
20744 20744 Trump has been speaking in favour of protectionism for most of his career, we expect him to be ready to push hard on new trade agreements and if necessary to implement tough measures on China as well as on the EU during his possible second term,.
20745 20745 We first contacted the local joint registrar 's office, to find out if any farmers in the state were willing to sell vegetables directly to the society members. Later, we sent a list of requirements to the point of contact in that village. We had the vegetables reach our doorstep the next day,.
20749 20749 Employers watch the labor market and balance carefully how many raises they have to give and how much time off, given the perceived threat of an employee leaving or of not being able to recruit,.
20753 20753 They have deposits on hand, and they 're able to access them. So I think that 's what 's potentially driving the reduced concern.
20758 20758 We just want the commission and the government to set up a fair and equitable playing field where the Amazons and Flipkarts can not abuse the system with unfair subsidies and their favored traders.
20759 20759 So much of humanity 's resources would be damaged or destroyed, so much would need to be devoted to rebuilding, moving, and resettling,.
20764 20764 The reserve price for Jawahar Talkies plot was fixed at Rs 40 crore, and we thought even if someone purchases the plot at the base price, our dues of Rs 23 crore would be easily recoverable. But, the stay on the auction at the last minute has been a huge setback for us. We can only hope that the Collector takes a decision tomorrow and reschedules the auction of the plot,.
20769 20769 could imply limits on the ability of monetary policy to support a recovery.
20776 20776 Anantkumar Hegde is perhaps reflecting the views of his masters. If he is not, his comments should invite the strictest possible action from his party.
20778 20778 I do n't know why he would want to come to Miami as we are a rebuilding team.
20780 20780 We will educate people who want vegan, gluten-free or plant-based that they can still eat real well and enjoy it,.
20785 20785 People who claim there is a ` trade-off' between environmental responsibility on one hand and economic and social development are simply misstating facts. These people are either uneducated about the increasing success of ` green development' models, or they are merely lying because they are paid by vested commercial interests,.
20789 20789 changes in fiscal policy must be made to address the budget situation, because our debt is growing on an unsustainable path.
20793 20793 We could safely increase the deficit, let 's say by another $ 500 billion or so, before we begin to see inflation accelerating to something that we would consider problematic,.
20794 20794 a couple of trillion on a Green New Deal or infrastructure, somebody better be getting this right, especially when the margin of error is not big,.
20796 20796 At the same time if that 's not the case and say only 10 % of the population have been infected we may have to wait until September and that would create huge social problems for many countries.
20799 20799 I think if we thought about those policies we would want those students here in the United States.
20807 20807 severe but likely to be temporary.
20813 20813 Using religion for the purpose of discrimination is not acceptable in the eyes of the Constitution. If citizenship should be granted, it should be on a fair and equitable basis, not on the basis of communal discrimination against one religion and in favour of others,.
20814 20814 If you are a manufacturer of toilet paper, you are going to plan your manufacturing capacity for a stable demand -- you want to be as efficient as possible,.
20817 20817 We think we are making progress because we are coming together and we continued willing to try our best to do more.
20823 20823 But I would have expected that, when performance improves, male and female CEOs are both protected from dismissal.
20827 20827 I do n't think they would have done this unless they felt the financial markets were at significant risk of freezing up tomorrow,.
20829 20829 wo n't kick into gear until they find a vaccine or a medical treatment that is effective for the virus. Until that happens, I do n't see people traveling, global trade will struggle and businesses, weighed down by uncertainty, wo n't invest or hire aggressively. We 're in the soup, more or less, until we have some solution to this virus.
20830 20830 We 're now in fear mode, but it can quickly turn around. Late 2018 is a pretty good case in point. It 's a lesson not to get caught up in the emotion.
20833 20833 Millions of job losses are likely in the coming weeks, particularly for households that live paycheque to paycheque,.
20836 20836 Unless this passes quickly, this would be worse for the economy than the [ 2007-2008 ] financial crisis,.
20837 20837 Modern monetary theory has found a timeless truth -- you have to think situationally,.
20839 20839 Guaranteeing the safety and wellbeing of our customers and our colleagues has to be our priority so we will only open if it is safe to do so and in compliance with the Government 's strict guidelines.
20841 20841 If you look at these tech demonstrators and what 's been done, really, starting back in the ’ 09 timeframe when JMR TD started, we are able to really clarify what can be aggressive, yet achievable, requirements ... ensure the affordability of the new product .... and to burn down risk as we move into the program of record,.
20843 20843 It may cost money, but there 's a public interest in being prepared for a disaster.
20846 20846 It makes it difficult to stuff all the things that we want and can now afford into the growing, but increasingly relatively much more limited, time that we have available to purchase and to enjoy them over our lifetimes,.
20847 20847 Known weaknesses in the US healthcare system could make the situation there even worse,.
20848 20848 Now we are seeing two factors ( at play ) : the fall of the oil prices and the consequences of the so-called coronavirus. I think that the latter is even more significant because it has an impact on the whole range of industries,.
20856 20856 People are doing amazing things with technology that may have been outside their comfort zones before,.
20857 20857 We should not allow foreigners to enter our education sector. This will lead to westernisation of education and will not be in national interest.
20858 20858 DFIs, as sovereign-backed non-banking financial companies, can leverage 30 times their capital,.
20862 20862 If we could shut off the epidemic, of course the economy would bounce back quickly,.
20865 20865 Other ideas that we 're throwing around internally right now are experiential or actual goods,.
20869 20869 What will happen if these terrorists enter Turkey among hundreds of thousands of civilians ?.
20870 20870 If an international conference were to be held, why did n't you do it ? Why are you following hegemon powers and put Turkey under their gravitational field,.
20873 20873 Had we asked why growth had slowed down in India when other countries were able to do well, the search for an answer would almost certainly have highlighted the shortcomings in our policies that could have been corrected.
20877 20877 If we were to get another 10 tonne we would be extremely lucky.
20878 20878 If you go back and look at the things [ Republicans ] tried to blow up, you can see that they 're tiny peanuts as a share of the total,.
20879 20879 I think if you look at this first stage China deal, it 's OK. There 's not a lot in it,.
20884 20884 That has been approved by Cabinet and we are waiting for the Statutory Instrument to be in place. We have received requests from various people with free funds and we are waiting for the Statutory Instrument to be in place then we can allow them.
20885 20885 It will take time and we have done everything in the past few months. We have done everything we can.
20886 20886 We have made considerable progress and we would have more meetings before I leave. We are confident and we are targeting March for the IPO that is US $ 750 million which will further go to strengthen our foreign exchange reserves.
20888 20888 African debt to China is $ 145 billion or so, over $ 8 billion of payments is required this year ... So that needs to be looked at,.
20889 20889 But for people that do n't have a job, it makes it less likely that they 're going to be able to get a job,.
20890 20890 I am so honored to be onstage with what I would say is a true profile in courage,.
20892 20892 It 's easy to understand why they might want to lock it in now, rather than risk having the market seize up, right ?.
20893 20893 Low levels of psychological safety can create a culture of silence.
20897 20897 There can ... be no question that the sanctions have affected Iran 's ability to contain the outbreak,.
20900 20900 But I think that 's only part of the story. There is the investment side. There is the enforcement side. There is the entrepreneurship side.
20902 20902 If you look at a chart of the Dow Jones over 100 years you do n't see any volatility,.
20903 20903 Malta must finally comply with European rules when it comes to anti-money laundering, the independence of the judiciary and banking supervision,.
20908 20908 I think macro funds are reluctant to get too bearish.
20910 20910 We can no longer ignore the strong economic case for restoring nature. Inaction will cost us far more than actions aimed at protecting nature 's contributions to the economy. To ensure positive global futures, we need to achieve more sustainable patterns of production and land use, and reform economic and financial systems to incentivize nature-based decision making.
20911 20911 For others of you, this is a huge struggle and I understand that .... But if you see same-gender couples walking around campus, being respectful, acting like straight couples, that 's really going to get you ready for the real world.
20916 20916 At the top theoretically, rates [ would ] be substantially higher.
20919 20919 Truthfully, I think he died alone,.
20921 20921 We set up a few key concerts because we were n't sure if people were going to be interested in this or not,.
20927 20927 They 'd give the consumer -- with his consent -- information, insights, analyses and proposals, and maybe even let him make payments. He could make better decisions in terms of both his needs and costs.
20929 20929 For some countries around the world, it is dangerous to keep expanding public sector debt, because it may be unsustainable, but in the major advanced economies like the U.S. and many European economies, the problem is more one of deflationary pressures,.
20931 20931 from verified sources, such as UNICEF or WHO, government health officials and trusted healthcare professionals ; and that you refrain from sharing information from untrustworthy or unverified sources.
20936 20936 While we 're looking for things to do at home, I thought it 'd be fun to share behind the scenes of my dad 's acting debut,.
20940 20940 If market illiquidity continues, I will support our taking further actions to address funding needs, including activating facilities like those the Federal Reserve has used in the past,.
20942 20942 It really feels like we have reached a tipping point so that we can do this.
20943 20943 I 've taught at Columbia for over two decades and have always told my students that if they did good valuation work, the market would agree with them,.
20945 20945 The OIG 's objective is to determine whether EPA policies and procedures were effective in addressing stakeholder risks in the EPA 's Dicamba pesticide registration decisions in 2016 and 2018,.
20947 20947 Why is the taxpayer backing up loans so that they can get reduced interest rates ?.
20948 20948 absolutely ridiculous and absurd. Such an action can be merely due to hysteria.
20950 20950 If we measure the fundamentals of the rupiah exchange rate, including against inflation, the current account deficit and interest rate differentials onshore and abroad, the rupiah is still undervalued and has the tendency to strengthen,.
20951 20951 Inflation in 2020 could be higher. One has to remember that higher inflation means higher budget revenues. Higher inflation is not a reason for concern,.
20953 20953 Old and inefficient coal-fired plants should go off the grid as soon as possible, and no new ones should be added,.
20954 20954 It 's just very hard for Canada not to be more or less in step with U.S. policy,.
20956 20956 The community should be very alarmed by this.
20959 20959 If it is a return to restriction, starting from a much less favourable point and much more disease spread, then the cumulative economic loss will be greatly magnified. The costs we have already borne will have been totally in vain.
20961 20961 This may actually force food importers to pay more for the food we import and sell here. That would affect produce, seafood, groceries, which are important staples right now, especially when people are buying provisions.
20964 20964 I 'm not very happy to be honest, not about the performance -- our or Banco de Portugal 's performance -- I 'm nor very happy about the ... mess in the legislative set-up here,.
20970 20970 We are not through the woods yet -- there could be a second wave.
20976 20976 We are watching it closely, as are other central banks and fiscal authorities, and if it necessitates some form of action, whether it 's on the macro-prudential side or the policy side, we will take it.
20977 20977 There is no reason for this shock to turn into the experience of 2008, a virtual lost decade in a number of economies, if we handle it well,.
20980 20980 Our banknotes celebrate the UK 's extraordinarily rich and diverse heritage and highlight the contributions of its greatest citizens. Turner 's art was transformative. I am delighted that the work of arguably the single most influential British artist of all time will now appear on another two billion works of art -- the new £ 20 notes that people can start using today.
20981 20981 If anybody wants downtown Clearwater to be more of a success, you have to bring a few more people down there to help support the businesses,.
20984 20984 Looking again at the direct and indirect impacts ... [ disruption ] could continue until April and May.
20990 20990 Africa may lose half of its gross domestic product with growth falling due to a number of reasons which include the disruption of global supply chains,.
20996 20996 Saudi Arabia, which has been a stabiliser of oil markets for many years can once again play a constructive role and as chair of the G20 can bring all key economies of the world, producers and consumers together, to have a dialogue to take measures to try to stabilize the oil markets.
20999 20999 The unprecedented decline in demand ... means that a successful supply response is just a part-mitigant in the short term. Even if producers were to agree to an arrangement that results in short term market balance, underlying spare capacity will rise to historic levels.
21000 21000 Hydogen can help overcome many difficult energy challenges. It can decarbonise hard-to-abate-sectors like steel, chemicals, tucks ships and planes. Hydrogen can also enhance energy security by diversifying the fuel mix and providing flexibility to balance grids.
21001 21001 There is no feasible agreement that could cut supply by enough to offset such near-term demand losses. However, the past week 's achievements are a solid start.
21002 21002 If [ coronavirus impact ] extends for six months or longer ... the job losses will feed to more job losses and that could be very detrimental for the economy and will hurt the confidence of home buying,.
21003 21003 The key is whether the stimulus package can reverse all these damages by the second half of the year.
21008 21008 They want to park their money in a first-class world economy, which is Australia, Canada, and the U.S. Hence, we may see greater demand from Chinese, wealthy households.
21010 21010 There are those who can read but could not comprehend. There are different levels,.
21011 21011 We believe that we should place our focus on quality because our Constitution is very clear that it does n't only talk about access to education but also specifically states that quality education should be available,.
21012 21012 So whether Chinese schools or public schools or local schools or other foreign schools, they have to comply with the requirements of law. So, what they usually do is to have extension of classes,.
21017 21017 The auto industry, they 're going to electric vehicles, they 're going to hydrogen, natural gas ... and we can lead that parade and the world, or we can watch everybody else drive away and leave us in their dust,.
21021 21021 We are losing species at an average of 1,000 times the natural extinction rate. This is a catastrophe we simply can not afford.
21022 21022 Had we acted 10 years ago, we would have needed now to reduce every year our emissions by 3.3 %, which would be doable. Because we have n't acted, we now need to reduce our emissions by 7.6 %, which is a stretch -- a massive stretch.
21025 21025 If you want to do something for global warming, become a vegetarian. Because I think the beef industry has been a huge culprit in global warming.
21026 21026 The powers-that-be have used a national issue to usurp power by stealth. When MPs have no discretionary powers, you may as well disband the Parliament.
21030 21030 We declare that freedom of speech and expression and the freedom to practice any profession or carry on any trade, business or occupation over the medium of internet enjoys constitutional protection under Article 19 ( 1 ) ( a ) and Article 19 ( 1 ) ( g ),.
21033 21033 I think environment is a feminist movement in India. If the young women take an aggressive role on environmental issues ... I am actually a great optimist,.
21037 21037 may be the most important document ever to come out of Silicon Valley.
21038 21038 I wanted the fairy tale ending that I thought I had and then I lost very dramatically,.
21039 21039 Engaged ! ! ! ! @ tom_bernthal, you are my everything. I could not love you more.
21040 21040 I 'm ready for the next step but I do n't know if he is,.
21047 21047 The question is now how to scale up such a program. We will work immediately on what more we can do,.
21049 21049 can help the poorest countries with immediate debt relief, which will free up vital resources for health spending, containment, and mitigation.
21064 21064 This program matters a great deal to determining whether the country is able to bounce back quickly or get sucked into a morass,.
21066 21066 All power to everybody to say that they want to attach themselves to the legacy of the former president. To the extent they are suggesting he 's endorsing them, I think it 's pretty clear he 's not.
21070 21070 Introducing such initiatives would help us achieve our targets,.
21071 21071 Guaranteeing the safety and wellbeing of our customers and our colleagues has to be our priority so we will only open if it is safe to do so and in compliance with the Government 's strict new guidelines.
21076 21076 It may be hard to prevent infections from spreading.
21078 21078 Not all can, or should, be saved given our limited fiscal resources.
21079 21079 The clean-up has to be undertaken on an emergency basis, otherwise sense of confidence which is needed in our NBFC, private banks and even in our state-owned banks that would be missing, that means financial sector can not contribute to the growth,.
21081 21081 Last week we concluded that the COVID-19 shock would produce a global recession as nearly all of the world contracts over the three months between February and April,.
21083 21083 The pandemic is creating new fault lines -- between those who can afford to stop working and those who ca n't ; those who are keeping their health insurance and those who are losing it,.
21086 21086 We 'd be surprised, but if Iran takes more drastic action than we are expecting, it will become a real risk. In the meantime, expect defensive stocks to outperform, with downward pressure on Treasury yields and gains for safe-haven currencies.
21088 21088 The pain is coming in April, when payrolls are likely to drop by perhaps 10M-plus,.
21089 21089 an all-out effort to ensure that the business sector can continue to exist even as economic activity temporarily collapses. The Fed is now effectively the direct lender of last resort to the real economy, not just the financial system.
21097 21097 seems to think he 'll be throwing [ him ] a bone.
21100 21100 Listen seriously a lot of people think I 'm a c * * * and I am a good looking c * * * but once this is put to bed we need to get Oasis back for a 1 of gig rite for charity c 'm on Noel we can then go back to our amazing solo careers c 'm on you know.
21102 21102 This is one of the last if not the last fully Australian designed and built aircraft,.
21105 21105 But, I think there are two positive points to bear in mind.
21106 21106 For employees looking to accelerate this in their firm they can point to the evidence on the positive impacts on firms profits and productivity from working from home,.
21108 21108 It is hard to think of [ a solution ] so long as people believe government can magically make bank lending safe.
21111 21111 We believe that this is a really good opportunity for domestic manufacturers of medical equipment to capitalise on the disruption and move towards indigenisation. The government should bolster the global standing of the industry,.
21113 21113 Our work provides some metrics for thinking about what alternative policies might be consequential in the future.
21118 21118 They ca n't pick winners or losers.
21119 21119 This decision is made for public health reasons -- to do everything we can to increase social distancing and do everything within our power to ensure that we can limit the risk of the spread of this virus,.
21126 21126 If Bauer bought Pacific Magazines, Bauer would remove its closest competitor in certain segments,.
21128 21128 Both QE and forward guidance should be part of the standard toolkit going forward.
21129 21129 The most important financial markets, including those for U.S. Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities, must work properly if lenders are to feel confident about extending credit to households and businesses in such unusual times,.
21130 21130 Such a programme would have to be carefully calibrated to minimize the credit risk taken by the Fed.
21133 21133 I remember the day of that 1979 draft for sure, my agent in those days Al Eagleson thought I was supposed to go earlier than I did but there were a lot of 18-year-olds from the World Hockey Association who came in,.
21135 21135 We recognize that people need to start making plans soon, so we thought it best to provide guidance now.
21141 21141 A turnaround can be commenced within three months after the coronavirus pandemic is controlled,.
21142 21142 This deal is wholly anti-national and I will ( be ) forced to go to court. We can not sell our family silver,.
21144 21144 So you can have a very stable measure that 's capturing socioeconomic status, or you can have a measure that 's freer of that, but that 's less stable. There 's not really a way to square that.
21146 21146 specific provisions in the budget that would serve India well.
21152 21152 We 'll just have to wait and see. That was a lot of stimulus for where the economy was, and should make it more resilient to these sorts of things.
21155 21155 If you want the statement in writing, but do n't want to pay the fee, consider printing from a home printer,.
21162 21162 And of course, we are extremely concerned about the recent attacks we have seen against civilian energy infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, or against coalition bases in Iraq -- bases which are important for our efforts to fight international terrorism in Iraq and in Syria.
21163 21163 At our meeting today, allies called for restraint and de-escalation. A new conflict would be in no-one 's interest,.
21165 21165 The whole aim, and President Ghani has clearly supported this many times, is that we would like to initiate an inter-Afghan negotiation process,.
21173 21173 The question is, what 's sustainable ? And that 's I think the big issue. If we shifted to a completely different regime, I think a lot of the policies that Warren and Sanders have said, in the short run, might well boost the economy, but I 'm not sure how good they 'd be for long-run productivity,.
21174 21174 The statement could provide a summary of changes in a consistent set of indicators on inflation, inflation expectations, the unemployment rate, employment growth, output growth, and financial conditions that the Committee regularly assesses to formulate its outlook and view of appropriate policy,.
21175 21175 When the lockdown is over, I think we 'll get a pretty decent bounce back.
21183 21183 Public investments in both education and infrastructure can yield greater benefits in promoting long-term growth than investing only in education or only in infrastructure because both types of investment strongly complement each other,.
21188 21188 I think a recession at this point is more likely than not,.
21193 21193 If they do n't know how bad it is, how can policymakers and people make good decisions, and where does it stop ?.
21201 21201 even if you train all the agriculture scientists in the world, and the animal husbandry experts, or soil scientists, even those who are agriculture economists, and those who know how to do the business, if you do n't have the right set of policies and the environment that is conducive, you are not going to have agriculture move from this smallholder dimension to a real enterprise,.
21203 21203 The RBA has signalled a long pause is likely. Governor Lowe reinforced this recently. Interestingly, the RBA opted to leave its growth forecast unchanged and instead take on a cautiously upbeat view with recent interruptions from the virus and global trade as temporary. Markets seem to have embraced this too,.
21204 21204 It is too early to tell what the impact will be, but the SARS outbreak in 2003 may provide a guide,.
21205 21205 When we met six months ago, I said that there were signs that the Australian economy may have reached a gentle turning point,.
21208 21208 The WHO ignored Taiwan 's warning that COVID-19 can be transmitted between humans, believing China 's lies instead.
21209 21209 There is no need to jam poles into the spokes of the gaming market 's wheels in a way that would pull it off the road, but at least you need to attach reflectors.
21210 21210 we do n't think this is a Black Swan.
21213 21213 But it would be completely unacceptable for the Home Office to try to water down the review 's conclusions and judgments about what went wrong.
21214 21214 People assume immigration is polarised but we did a home affairs committee report on it speaking to people all over the country and found it is possible to build consensus. You need a system that is controlled so it 's fair. I 'm less pessimistic than some people but it 's possible we 'll get stuck if we do n't listen to what anyone else is saying.
21215 21215 Although there are some opportunities to buy, I would say it 's probably a good idea to keep some powder dry for another downturn. We might see a double bottom,.
21220 21220 I did n't pay the friendly warning -- or whatever it was -- any regard, basically, because I had no reason to fear a complaint from ( Woman H ).
21224 21224 This is going to be lasting at least a year. I think unemployment goes north of 10 %.
21225 21225 very reluctantly. But first I would make it clear that there are limits to monetary policy.
21227 21227 will win faster if people stuck in closed societies can freely vote with their feet.
21231 21231 Doing the front facade is the next step and it will re-instate it to the 1904 original heritage look. We will bring it back to the look when it was first built, that 's step one. At the same time we will be working inside to replace or upgrade services such as sewer, stormwater, plumbing and power.
21236 21236 I assure you of the state government 's assistance, and that a panel of inquiry would be set up to look into the cause of the fire and to establish immediate cause of the incident.
21237 21237 It is a synergy between the world of innovation and regulation that must surely change,.
21241 21241 I feel the law should be scrapped, because such an Act should not have been passed in the first place,.
21246 21246 We do n't know when it will come to an end. So, we ca n't say immediately what impacts it would have on the sector.
21247 21247 We should do all we can so that the situation does not develop like in other countries,.
21252 21252 You put me on the air to prognosticate, but it is so close in those states ... there 's no way to tell. There are n't many lawn signs out, there does n't seem to be much door-knocking, I was expecting to see politics everywhere, and I have n't seen it.
21253 21253 A geopolitical and geoeconomic rivalry seems to start -- even if they couch the relationship using nice, friendly, diplomatic language,.
21260 21260 You do n't need to be a virologist, immunologist, or epidemiologist to understand why a 30-day nationwide lockdown makes sense,.
21262 21262 We were sufficiently concerned about the health and economic implications of the coronavirus that we considered, for the first time ever, liquidating the portfolio in its entirety because we believed it was likely that markets would decline materially,.
21265 21265 I had become bullish because of my belief that the entire country would soon go into lockdown, and that would be the fastest and best way to minimize the impact of the virus,.
21268 21268 Is our monetary policy target -- ( inflation of ) just under 2 % -- where it should be ? Should it be less, should it be more ? Should it be symmetrical ? Should it be asymmetrical ? ... We had heated discussions about that last week in the ( Governing ) Council.
21276 21276 I believe that monetary policy is in a good place and should continue to support sustained growth, a strong labor market, and inflation running close to our symmetric 2 % objective. As long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with this outlook, the current stance of monetary policy likely will remain appropriate.
21277 21277 I think when people were thinking about immigration policy they were n't paying special attention to the students that come here,.
21279 21279 It should be noted that Vlieghe is the third consecutive BoE official hinting toward a rate cut, after statements made by BoE 's [ Silvana ] Tenreyro on Friday and from BoE Gov. Mark Carney on Thursday,.
21281 21281 They might have built up debt over Christmas and the tax refund is an important part of squaring their balances.
21282 21282 This kind of crisis can catalyze or even accelerate an ongoing change,.
21283 21283 We are closely monitoring market developments and we stand ready to provide all the liquidity the financial system needs so that it can continue to serve Canadians,.
21287 21287 Clearly, this balance can change over time as the data evolve.
21292 21292 If you legislate to make scarce things cheaper, you will only succeed in making them even scarcer. If you think the shelves were bare after all the panic buying three weeks ago, just wait until you see the effects of price controls.
21293 21293 It is not within the power of the central bank to change the structural conditions that would turn around the negative interest rate trend,.
21296 21296 Right now there does n't seem to be much fear that at least in the short term the Fed will raise rates,.
21299 21299 So, given that, he is basically saying we could be in a recession. May be, he is not exactly using the word ... I do n't know, could we be in a recession ? That 's the problem, we are not measuring the informal sector. We do n't know how much it is tagged,.
21300 21300 This time, with expectations of a V shaped recovery in China, that long lag may not be in place.
21303 21303 You 'll see Jonah 's evolution through this world that begins in this very graphic novel kind of place. But so too when I grew up and began to learn more and could understand more about the depth of degrees of the horror that [ my grandmother ] experienced, those colors began to desaturate and I began to see in stark reality what she went through,.
21304 21304 I 'd love to continue telling the stories of people like my grandmother. I feel like she 's here in some way every time I write a line or see a cut. She 's sitting on my shoulder and I hope she 'd be very proud.
21308 21308 I wanted to showcase Jews not as intellectual, nebbishy, victimized, or emasculated, but to show them with might and strength,.
21312 21312 We also had failures as all politicians do but all-in-all I think the experiment was good,.
21318 21318 Stimulus that is not seen or recognized by individuals is unlikely to affect their sentiment,.
21327 21327 cure can not be worse than the disease.
21328 21328 It 's important to put things in perspective. This is a 100-year-old Canadian company that says they are ` strong supporters' of carbon pricing and of policies aimed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions, and whose production would replace more polluting sources of oil. Here, then, the perfect is really the enemy of the good,.
21332 21332 If stress and boredom lead to lower productivity, then there is a clear business interest in seeking remedies,.
21333 21333 It 's a study in what should n't be done in corporate America,.
21334 21334 As a shareholder, I would want John Visentin, who is running Xerox to run the company, because Visentin, I think has shown already his ability at Xerox and has cut the heck out of costs there and done a great job,.
21341 21341 The thing damaging our economy is a virus. Everyone who is trying to stop that virus is working to limit the damage it does to our economy and help our eventual rebound. The choice may well be taking pretty extreme steps now or taking very extreme steps later.
21345 21345 the possibility that the Fed might actually cut rates in the coming year.
21347 21347 That is true, but it has been pulling back from having bricks and is more and more virtual. I personally think that was a big mistake.
21355 21355 Much of the immediate economic impact of a pandemic can be traced to the efforts to contain it, rather than from the effects of the disease itself. As we attempt to quarantine those who might spread the disease, we shut down a lot of economic activity.
21356 21356 Had we not suffered a supply disruption, our 4Q numbers could be as strong as 4.3 %, and for the whole of this year, instead of the 4.3 % [ as announced ] ... it could be as high as 4.7 %.
21361 21361 I think [ emergency relief packages ] will help and in this regard -- I think that Congress 's Republicans are simply going to have to hold their noses and vote for a bill that contains a great many programs that in normal times they understandably would n't like, because these are n't normal times.
21366 21366 A lot of forecasters have been saying, ` If we were to see a recession in the next year or two, it would be coming from some external shock,' and indeed that 's just what we 're getting,.
21367 21367 shows how severe this pandemic is, despite what some would like to believe.
21368 21368 Unfortunately, this shows how severe this pandemic is, despite what some would like to believe,.
21378 21378 We will do a mid-term review, and if the impact is so much, we will need to do an adjustment in the budget, working together with the National Assembly,.
21382 21382 So sellers can expert to sell their home in a shorter time and, likewise, buyers can expect to still have a good number of choices.
21383 21383 Violence and civil strife are alien to this land. We must not lose this gem. It is what defines us a people.
21384 21384 That is good. But they must also be held accountable,.
21387 21387 entail working in unfamiliar circumstances or surroundings, or working in clinical areas outside of their usual practice for the benefit of patients and the population as a whole.
21391 21391 The faster people are recruited to clinical trials and other studies, the sooner we will get the evidence so patients can get the best possible treatment. Those who volunteer for studies will help others in the future.
21395 21395 Expectations among citizens, I think more than those of capital markets, that is something that has to be managed very carefully.
21400 21400 We do n't understand why the parliament would go to recess. The AKP and its ally, MHP [ the Nationalist Movement Party ], may think that there would be no need for the parliament as they have already passed the omnibus bills,.
21407 21407 Smart beta or factor investing ( example, momentum, low-volatility, etc ) allows you to beat the index on a risk-adjusted basis.
21410 21410 could be rationalized with the influence of bots.
21412 21412 Employers may also be alive to the potential cost savings of encouraging or requiring greater working from home, especially if they have opted to invest in technologies to facilitate it. A reduction in office use could also weigh persistently on demand for rental space and rents, which may feed through into lower cost inflation and a period of weaker price inflation.
21413 21413 If people find domestic suppliers, they will stick with them ... because of those perceived risks.
21416 21416 if it is funded in a very efficient way, it could lead to positive economic growth, despite its price tag,.
21419 21419 They have frequently proposed cuts to the program, and under President Bush, sought to privatize it. They may well use a temporary tax cut as an opportunity to weaken the program 's finances so that they can then push for cuts or privatization.
21423 21423 Government needs no popular support as long as it can secure obedience,.
21424 21424 The Fed has to be careful about defining what it needs to do or what it can do,.
21425 21425 This was a team that could make a pretty deep run.
21427 21427 Anyone now from our school households can come to our school site and request as many meals for their household.
21429 21429 It is certainly true that some of the data have been disappointing, however there have been some signs that we could see a pickup in the weeks ahead .... With a new budget due on March 11, it certainly would n't hurt for the Bank of England to hold fire.
21430 21430 It would not be irrational to do so when risk is largely unknown,.
21433 21433 The government should do what any good housewife would do if money was short-look at their accounts and see what was wrong.
21434 21434 This is the nature of software development now, and quality assurance must change in step,.
21438 21438 Back in the 1940s and 1950s, virtually all kids in America would grow up to have a higher standard of living than their parents did. So for children born in 1940, for example, 90 percent of them went on to have a higher standard of living than their parents. And if you look at kids who were born in the 1980s, who are turning 30 today, when we 're measuring their incomes that number is down to 50 percent,.
21439 21439 Davos is one of the few places where I can directly confront Russian officials with human rights violations,.
21445 21445 Though water was supplied in tankers in some of the buildings after the collector intervened, we are not sure if it will be a permanent solution to the problem. I heard many employees working in Vismaya and TCS are not planning to come to work on Friday,.
21453 21453 We must maintain open and competitive markets in order to to develop the aviation sector and our economies.
21454 21454 When there are not many cases, the risk associated with going out tomorrow is not high, but the risk to society is very high because you could expose others.
21455 21455 A key concern about a long-lasting impact of the sudden stop of the world economy is the risk of a wave of bankruptcies and lay-offs that not only can undermine the recovery but erode the fabric of our societies,.
21458 21458 We estimate the gross external financing needs for emerging market and developing countries to be in the trillions of dollars, and they can cover only a portion of that on their own, leaving residual gaps in the hundreds of billions of dollars. They urgently need help,.
21460 21460 We are impressed by Morocco 's determination to pursue its major structural reforms so that its economy can meet the aspirations of the Moroccan people,.
21461 21461 We all recognise that the situation with the spread of the coronavirus is very serious and could well get worse. This affects us all,.
21465 21465 or else we would have been talking of a recession,.
21469 21469 the academy is a place open to different views, not a narrow-mindedness that could constrain good dialogue.
21472 21472 I am particularly concerned about our low-income and more vulnerable members. These countries may see financing needs rise rapidly as the economic and human cost of the virus escalates. Our staff is currently working on identifying vulnerable countries and estimating potential financing needs should the situation deteriorate further. The fund has resources available to support the membership,.
21475 21475 This will likely also increase job losses.
21478 21478 I strongly believe that the best way we can fight international terrorism is not always by deploying NATO troops in big combat operations,.
21482 21482 We are united in condemning Iran 's support of a variety of different terrorist groups. At the meeting today, allies called for restraint and de-escalation. A new conflict would be in no one 's interest. So Iran must refrain from further violence and provocations.
21483 21483 This is why we are considering taking on some of the coalition 's current training activities. We will also explore what more we can do beyond this first step.
21485 21485 I believe that monetary policy is in a good place and should continue to support sustained growth, a strong labor market and inflation running close.
21486 21486 Broadly speaking, I would reject the suggestion that just because this expansion is in year 11, it 's about to end.
21492 21492 A broad and equitable debt relief process is urgently needed, so IDA countries can concentrate their resources on fighting the pandemic and its economic and social consequences.
21494 21494 They would n't normally get this,.
21495 21495 A much higher share of people who ca n't telework will lose their jobs in this recession than those who can,.
21497 21497 Based on new GDP forecasts, we project that nearly 20mn workers will be laid off or furloughed by July, with losses in every state,.
21500 21500 We need the digital currency a little bit less I would argue internally, but rather to help preserve the primacy of the dollar worldwide.
21502 21502 It would be anathema to me to suggest we devalue our money to gain a trade advantage,.
21503 21503 would be one potential replacement.
21505 21505 With this trip to a symbolic city like Kauda I want to tell the people in every corner of the country that they are not forgotten and while they might have been out of sight, they were never out of our hearts and minds.
21507 21507 Either China massively increases imports and reduces current account surplus from the current 1.5 percent of GDP, or it engages in trade diversion away from current providers of goods which compete with the US,.
21508 21508 Before that the government either needs to recapitalize the smaller banks or get a stronger lender or an asset manager to buy the weaker ones with a caveat they lend to small businesses.
21509 21509 That can only happen through a combination of shadow banking and lending by smaller and regional banks,.
21513 21513 The industry is likely to emerge in a much more healthy position with many of the zombie companies that were a dead weight on returns removed, even paving the way for an attractive international offering of Saudi Aramco,.
21517 21517 Now with financial markets getting quite concerned that this is n't just a mild outbreak that will slow economic growth but might have more dire consequences, we think the Bank of Canada, taking that on board, they 're likely to want to lower the policy rate,.
21519 21519 Vice President Pence is a former governor, I know him a little bit from those days and I think it was a good choice.
21525 21525 We should not be giving self-graded take home exams to polluting companies. And allowing merely 60 days for public comment on these sweeping changes is not nearly enough time to fully consider its broad, far-reaching implications.
21526 21526 This would seem to fly in the face of rational rulemaking, which requires the benefits to exceed the costs, not the other way around,.
21527 21527 While you ca n't predict them, you should know they can come around. You should be thinking these types of scenarios are possible. Does that mean you change your risk appetite ? the answer is no in my view. But you need to always know that they will occur you just do n't know what flavour.
21528 21528 Whether it 's an oil shock, a war, a pandemic or an asteroid invasion,.
21533 21533 I think it is terrific President Trump has come around to the idea that Americans should get checks. They should n't have to go to a workplace to get it,.
21534 21534 There should be a very high bar before bailouts for particular industries are considered,.
21539 21539 the good news -- if there is any to be had -- is that far fewer people crossed our paths recently than is usually the case.
21542 21542 In the same way it took more than one meeting for this group to discuss the issues, it 's likely to take more than one month for the Corporation to respond as well,.
21544 21544 The strength of the recovery will depend a lot on what governments do now during this period of containment ... [ they should ] provide necessary economic support required for households, for firms, to prevent them from becoming bankrupt, so those measures are very central, alongside health measures to contain the virus. Once the recovery happens and we are past the pandemic stage it would be ... for advanced economies to produce [ a coordinated ] fiscal stimulus,.
21546 21546 I would urge the President to release them so that we move on. It 's an opportunity. If the President does not fire them that 's a recipe for unrest,.
21551 21551 She would take potato peels from the trash cans and store them and give them to other people in her bunk. It was dangerous, she could have been shot for doing it, but she risked her life so people could eat. Even though all she was giving them was scraps.
21552 21552 It was for this reason that I made the decision that all of the concentration camp prisoners ( and survivors ) in the series would be given tattoos above the number 202,499,.
21553 21553 Any time you portray the Holocaust or Nazis on screen, controversy is invited. To me there 's even more urgency to tell this story because of that.
21557 21557 The timeline of the collapse of the Soviet Union can be traced to September 13, 1985,.
21566 21566 Today 's gon na be the day that they 're gon na throw it back to you / By now you should have somehow realised what you 've got to do / Wash your hands, scrubs your toes / Scratch your arse and pick your nose / C ’ mon, you know.
21567 21567 We know the business sector has loans close to a trillion dollars if they are saving a little more on their interest payments -- it wo n't be the thing that fixes the economy -- but it helps with the margin.
21568 21568 It is a good idea to their credit, I think the concept of hibernation is a good one, I 'll be watching with a huge amount of interest in how they frame that.
21571 21571 As somebody who has been associated with the power sector for almost three decades including as minister, the call to go dark for 9 minutes at 9 pm on the 5 April can have a deep impact on the grid and its stability. I sincerely hope this is being properly managed.
21574 21574 Unfortunately in the public, the propaganda is that the Congress is soft on minority communalism. It is a reality. We have to address this issue. We can not live in a make-believe world. We should wake up.
21575 21575 This can only be stated by someone who has never faced a direct election and has no constituents to answer to,.
21576 21576 Congress leaders have to reinvent themselves. Congress party has to reinvent itself if it has to be relevant. Otherwise, we are staring at irrelevance. Our arrogance has to go, even after six years out of power sometimes, some of us behave as if we are still ministers,.
21577 21577 I know that the Kerala government has passed a resolution but it 's a political resolution. Whether it will stand the test of judicial scrutiny, I am not 100 per cent sure,.
21578 21578 I got 25 police officers raiding my office. What should I do ?.
21580 21580 Of course, if the virus continues to spread and gets out of control, and we see closures not only in China but also in India and the United States and everywhere else in the world, then it would be a big problem,.
21582 21582 The ACCC 's decision not to oppose this deal should not be read as an indication that the ACCC will take a similar view on future possible acquisitions by Bunnings. Expansion into more specialist retailing in particular segments by acquisition of existing competitors, as opposed to organic growth, will be very carefully considered.
21584 21584 Leaving TPG and Vodafone in their current state would not create more competition in the retail mobile market,.
21585 21585 There 's a lot of times where they 're getting charged for things they should n't have been, and promised things they do n't get - and also, you 've got the potential for competition problems because it 's a very concentrated market.
21588 21588 And he said, ` I 'm going to send you to Tokyo to fluff the fans so to speak, for the rugby world cup.' I always dreamed of going to Tokyo but I never thought I 'd end up there.
21592 21592 Ang sabi namin, yung mga anak nila should go to the nearest public schools at saka the other day, nagpirma ako ng order na ang mga bata a pupunta dyan sa mga public schools kagaya ng sa Marawi, tanggapin with or without documentation. Saka na lang yung mga requirements,.
21594 21594 If you take Palaro, you take 30,000 learners as well as parents and grandparents attending. And we have been advised to take care with exposing our children to public places. So right now, the policy is temporary postponement of all these activities,.
21595 21595 Can somebody with a piece of wisdom explain to me what advantages Turkey has got in Syria ? We host 3.6 million Syrians and we have spent $ 40 billion. The government is concerned of around one million more refugees from Idlib,.
21601 21601 there are scenarios where things could be very bad, and there are certainly also scenarios where we could have recession globally if things do go in the wrong direction,.
21610 21610 which may well facilitate a quicker economic recovery.
21611 21611 If we were going to have retaliation to the retaliation, there would be reprisal .... That looks like it 's not going to be the case,.
21614 21614 Policies will ultimately prevail, but the means and the timing will determine what the subsequent landscape looks like. Everyone, from governments to companies to households to investors, can do their part to achieve a better outcome.
21615 21615 The Middle East is getting even more uncertain by the day. This is likely to intensify rivalries in a region already littered with proxy wars,.
21616 21616 Rausser College has some of the best economists in the world and some of the best scientists in the world, and by working together, as they must, they uniquely position the college to provide not only the fundamental science, but also the practical solutions, needed to tackle these challenges.
21618 21618 That 's what we wanted to examine -- can you turn down isoprene production, and does it matter to biomass productivity and general plant health ? It looks like it does n't impair either significantly.
21626 21626 because when you grow an airline, you will need accommodation for the staff, and you will need to bring in some specialized people or experts and you will need to provide accommodation for your cabin crew closer to the airport.
21637 21637 Survey data suggest UK economic activity has picked up sharply since election.
21638 21638 It 's very early days and we are, like others, monitoring this quite closely, as you would expect, and, like Chair Powell, I do n't want to speculate in terms of orders of magnitude,.
21647 21647 You can only facilitate. If you look at the two, then it is not possible to say that you can deliver because it is not upon you. You are facilitating.
21649 21649 Youth unemployment must be given top priority. With 12 million graduates entering the labour market each year and only 3 million of them getting jobs, the mountain of youth unemployment is rising annually,.
21654 21654 We 've shown in the elections since that we can stop election interference and ensure privacy.
21663 21663 To me, losing greater than 99 % of coral reefs is an absolute catastrophe that 's just one dimension of this experiment that we 're doing on our planet, and we 're just six or eight years away from that being inevitable. That 's why it is a climate emergency. That 's not hyperbole, that 's where we 're at,.
21668 21668 Every citizen is a tax payer and wants betterment of civic amenities and services. It is not a largesse, but the right of municipal bodies to get their due share. Once their due shares are given, it would further lead to democratic strengthening of local bodies. The country can not progress without local bodies getting their GST shares,.
21669 21669 This time, the ban on construction activities was unusually long and it was a huge set back for the sector. The air quality had improved last month and the ban should have been lifted earlier,.
21674 21674 Probably every major city in America has safety-net hospitals in gentrifying areas, where the real estate is so much more valuable than the hospital to the private-equity company.
21675 21675 If Sprint goes bankrupt, its assets will likely be sold to the other three companies, potentially enhancing the already strong dominance of the two market leaders,.
21680 21680 A man pissing all over a woman 's work ... seems right,.
21681 21681 at this point would be self-serving and of limited.
21682 21682 For some reason progressives do n't object when companies pay money out to shareholders through dividends. Buybacks are superior because they give shareholders a choice. Shareholders must receive a dividend when it 's declared and pay taxes on it. In a share buyback, investors who want cash can sell some shares and pay taxes. If they do n't want cash, they can choose to hold on to their shares.
21683 21683 He has beliefs, but he is curious about the intellectual debate. It is why he spends so much time at university. I also find him rather modest. He is not an arrogant or a showy person at all. He is a modest, smart, intellectual, personable person.
21684 21684 Is that the fault of the science team that developed the model, the engineers, the people who did the data mining, or the business people who did n't understand the problem they were trying to solve ?.
21688 21688 It 's a very dangerous game, but I do n't think she has a choice,.
21693 21693 It would only help to mitigate the damage we are seeing.
21701 21701 If that process does n't work, then we would have to consider a regulatory solution.
21707 21707 I mean everybody 's economic needs should be met, that people should have the dignity of work that the poor should be helped, that this is about the core ideas of human wellbeing.
21709 21709 Sterling is the weakest of the major currencies today, shedding about 0.5 % by around midday. hree considerations appear to be weighing on the pound,.
21710 21710 China is four times bigger than it was when SARS broke out ... so in some ways, China represents a downside economic shock. Countries will have to respond with fiscal policy or monetary policy or accept slower growth,.
21712 21712 I do think our communications could be crisper,.
21713 21713 Many of the home sales that are likely to be missed during the first part of 2020 may simply be pushed into late summer and autumn parts of the year.
21714 21714 Under historical spread conditions [ given the rock-bottom Treasury note yield ], the mortgage rate should have been around 2.5 %. But we 're not in normal times.
21720 21720 It 's not like a regular business cycle ; anything to slow the spread of the virus is the greatest economic stimulus you could have, and it 's now clear that U.S. government policy is not doing that.
21725 21725 As for resources, they are fully available, all these decisions must be made and start working right now, from the beginning of the year, so in this sense I want to assure you that work is already underway and I hope for your support,.
21729 21729 What if the U.S. next week reports 2,000 new cases in a day ? Markets would look at that and see it as a sharp uptick and we could have a very messy day again if that happens.
21733 21733 should limit the damage,.
21734 21734 We expect a further decline in April, which ought then to be the floor, or close to it.
21736 21736 A particular bilateral trade deficit or surplus is totally devoid of economic meaning.
21739 21739 New opportunities may present themselves that are superior to investments we currently own. This may lead us to sell certain of our existing holdings including investments we recently purchased,.
21741 21741 Interestingly however, the bounce in risk sentiment did not transmit into Europe, where investor confidence fell sharply this month, possibly from a combination of weaker economic data and continued uncertainty of a hard Brexit on the region.
21743 21743 It 's a concern that one might do one 's job as an analyst and face police scrutiny and misinformation that is not even direct, but is clandestine, that undermines the quality of my reputation and that of my co-author [ Cornell University 's ] Nancy Brooks,.
21746 21746 The government should focus on restoring the people 's faith in them. There is no need to waste time and attention on mere speculation,.
21749 21749 It is a fabrication, just as she has encouraged at least five other people to exaggerate or make claims against me.
21754 21754 Doctors and scientists are working flat out to deliver better testing and better treatments, but this will take time. Before then we will run out of capacity in intensive care units if we do not obey these instructions. These measures are therefore necessary to prevent thousands of deaths. I urge everyone to comply with them immediately.
21756 21756 In the end, if it 's just the Chinese or maybe the Russians, then I think the breakup of the European Union will be unstoppable.
21757 21757 It stipulates that ministers, agency heads, governors, regents and mayors must prioritize using their existing budgets to support mitigation efforts in accordance with protocols established by the COVID-19 task force,.
21760 21760 If a laboratory finds a therapy, in the current climate there will be intense pressure for the treatment to be sold at a low cost,.
21762 21762 In scenarios that are increasingly spoken of as the norm, over one-third of the U.S. population -- some 100 million people -- will at some point be infected by the virus. If 3-5 % require hospitalization ( as seems to be the case, based on available data ), some five million hospital beds will be required over the life of the pandemic,.
21766 21766 Typically, what 's happened in the past is there may be a short-term impact of an epidemic or a pandemic but, longer term, it seems to have relatively little influence, and I think many observers are hoping that will be true this time,.
21767 21767 could engender risks to financial stability as investors reach for yield and take on leverage.
21768 21768 If it does n't hit in a substantial way in the United States, that 's less likely,.
21769 21769 Unemployment rates for a time may go to Depression levels. But this is very different than the Great Depression or the recession in the U.S. economy that we experienced in 2009 and after,.
21770 21770 We know that social distancing is the one thing that we can do to get ahead of this,.
21773 21773 At this stage, we think the balance is still more in favour of this being an event-driven bear market, suggesting that the rebound in equity markets will be swift, but from a lower level,.
21776 21776 The precise magnitude of the financial impact is highly dependent on the duration of the closures and how quickly we can resume normal operations.
21779 21779 YouTube 's model is an ad-funded model, they 're generating $ 15 billion from ads ... that is a massive business and it 's successful without having too many paying subscribers ... ( but ) I worry about what regulators might do to that business,.
21781 21781 One story I read this morning was how doctors and hospitals were reporting a big reduction in people who are showing up in the emergency room for conditions where they normally would -- for instance, for heart attacks,.
21782 21782 There is often a stigma to being unemployed, or people feel there is a stigma, and that can lead to other negative health effects,.
21785 21785 The central bank is doing what it can,.
21787 21787 It is obviously very convenient for the elites to explain everything by stigmatizing the supposed racism of the less advantaged.
21788 21788 What is he trying to achieve with this unsubstantiated comments, is it because we are in an election year or what ...,.
21789 21789 a strong indication of the economy and market confidence. This is important because the other ways to raise funds, such as raising taxes, is difficult to do during a crisis.
21794 21794 businesses may start to feel a little bit better about things, and we should see wage growth begin to pick up again.
21796 21796 Under any scenario, if we get a good stimulus package, I still think it 's a big hit. It 's hard to gauge but my guess is we 'll be down 2 percent to 3 percent in Q1 and around the same in Q2, assuming we get a lot of fiscal stimulus,.
21797 21797 If the American consumer loses faith, and the coronavirus will be a real test of faith, then a recession is going to happen,.
21798 21798 Overall, three - and six-month average ADP job gains now stand at 159,000 and 151,000, respectively, close to the 12-month average of 163,000 but still well below 2018 's pace of 213,000. This suggests labor markets have settled into a steady, more modest pace of growth,.
21799 21799 A global recession is more likely than not,.
21801 21801 her wage would rise to $ 65,000 -- her full labor compensation. With an income tax of 6 % -- which, if applied to a base large enough, would be enough to fund universal health insurance -- she would have to pay about $ 4,000 more in tax. But the net gain would be enormous : $ 11,000. Instead of taking home $ 50,000, the secretary would take home $ 61,000.
21802 21802 It is vital to put in place effective policies to provide income support to those who currently can not work.
21803 21803 It 's always easy to talk about what other people are not doing right, but we can also think introspectively about ourselves. How many people in this room in the last month have eaten more than they think they should ?.
21804 21804 I 've been a little concerned by what I thought was the excessively cautious strategy that PCORI used in its early years, which is not hard to understand because of its almost near-death experience and the political pushback they were facing,.
21805 21805 Neighbours may not always agree, but that does n't mean they do n't work together on the many other issues on which they do.
21814 21814 This is in the larger context of black men fitting the description of a suspect who has a hood on, who has a face covering on,.
21820 21820 During COVID-19 restrictions, Soldiers and Families may be separated from the general population and may not have ` face to face' contact with Leaders and AER Staff to process an assistance application,.
21821 21821 This is a site of national historical significance that people can learn from.
21823 21823 The carbon tax is, from an economic efficiency perspective, the perfect policy, which is why lots of people, especially economists, keep saying we must price carbon emissions. But this statement is factually incorrect ; even 100 % decarbonization can be achieved by regulations alone,.
21830 21830 So sad to see # TakeMeOut come to an end. I owe everything to the show, the wonderful producers, everyone backstage, @ PaddyMcGuinness & the contestants of series 8. My little family would n't have existed without it.
21831 21831 The aim of our policy actions has been to ensure that the economic effects prove temporary, by minimising business failures and job losses that could cause a lasting reduction in the supply capacity of the economy,.
21832 21832 The EU and the United Kingdom would fall under WTO rules, which is n't hell but is far from today 's heaven. It would hurt, which would be stupid,.
21833 21833 The rental vacancy rate decreased in Burnaby in 2019, and that coincided with a year in which the universe of rental apartments also decreased by 255 units. That 's due to the number of units taking offline, because of eviction and demolition, exceeding the number of new rental units that were completed. Burnaby led the region last year in terms of condo construction, and it 's not always clear whether removals from the rental universe are in fact replaced with rental, or replaced with condos or other development.
21834 21834 There are increases in the credit card delinquency rate that make you wonder whether some parts of the population are not doing as well, or whether this is just a result of more relaxed lending standards,.
21835 21835 This is the time to keep kicking China while it 's down. The Chinese economy was growing at its slowest rate in decades. Its foreign trade balance has weakened tremendously. Its exports to the United States -- by its own statistics, which ... can be dodgy -- fell by about 20 percent, last year.
21841 21841 If you travel a lot, maybe you want those rewards for travel,.
21843 21843 public health must prevail over the economy.
21844 21844 That 's a long way from now. At the top theoretically, rates [ would ] be substantially higher.
21845 21845 the leading opposition contender for Venezuela 's May presidential election, Henri Falcón, was told by US officials that the Trump administration would consider financial sanctions against him if he entered the presidential race.
21850 21850 What we 'd hoped would be a V-shaped recovery ends up being a Nike swoosh,.
21857 21857 No, we 're not that far, and we 're just going to assess it in the next week or so,.
21868 21868 It follows a donation of £ 6,000 in December and one of £ 25,000 last August and upholds the long tradition of positive interaction by LOSC with the O 's. I should like to thank our club members for their loyal support in enabling the club to make these donations and to our committee for their ongoing hard work at LOSC.
21869 21869 There is enough potential in the country to manage the situation without making any emotional decisions. We can manage the situation while maintaining the level of social welfare we have achieved, without creating any additional problems for the financial sector.
21871 21871 Understanding changes in mobility patterns is important for the government to establish whether the current restrictions are likely to contain the spread of the disease and whether more or different, interventions should be put in place in the coming days or weeks. This work shows the power of data and is a good example of how it can benefit everyone.
21873 21873 It 's like a no-interest loan to them and can help stem the revenue loss.
21875 21875 These appointments demonstrate our commitment to nurturing talent and rewarding success. We have a deep pool of highly qualified and dedicated employees, who can be challenged with more responsibility in attaining our corporate vision,.
21876 21876 You can put down all the money in the world, but the G20 needs to be talking about funding and distribution of ventilators and vaccines. You need public health officials as much as finance ministers.
21878 21878 But, I think the Islamic Republic 's penchant for repression is high regardless of whatever anyone says in D.C.
21882 21882 can create a place to sort of find community,.
21883 21883 If there 's a savior of the auto industry, it would be [ President ] Obama,.
21886 21886 With the land area suitable for arable farming expected to drop from 32 % to 7 % under AMOC collapse, we could see a major reduction in the value of agricultural output,.
21887 21887 I have no plans for big changes. As they say, ` If it ai n't broke, do n't fix it.
21888 21888 I would n't blink an eye if we spent $ 500 billion or $ 1 trillion on fiscal stimulus, if it is directed at the people who need it most,.
21889 21889 If this explodes into a full blown Eurozone crisis then it would be a huge crisis, self-inflicted crisis that 's really totally unnecessary given where we stand,.
21890 21890 Regulators must act urgently to block this doom scenario,.
21893 21893 There will be difficulties in continuing to maintain that growth and it will probably drop significantly, but we can solve it due to the economic fundamentals we have in the medium term,.
21899 21899 It 's the perception that I think is relevant if people have different experiences with law enforcement that are prejudicial.
21901 21901 she may have allowed herself to become a target of Beijing 's agents of influence in Australia. I am worried about her vulnerability, and also how this is going to have an impact on her political party and the democratic political system here in Australia.
21902 21902 Students on this campus deserve leaders who will lead boldly and bravely, not those who are going to cave whenever the administration pushes back or worse, peddle bigotry and ignorance that threatens our campus community,.
21903 21903 Thanks to the task force that was launched two weeks ago, the public research institutions in Luxembourg have joined forces in the fight against COVID-19 and can provide valuable support and knowledge to help us make data-based decisions. The CON-VINCE study will be one of the key elements for an empirical basis in the handling of the current crisis.
21904 21904 What about Canadian lamb producers or producers of sorghum and lentils ? We have a deal with the European Union. We do n't have one with Britain,.
21907 21907 I was asked to give my details in writing including my name, address and age. I was also asked to submit my medical documents. The members of the crime branch team asked me where I was at the time of the incident and where exactly I was attacked. They also asked me if the incident was recorded on the CCTV cameras installed in the library,.
21908 21908 In addition, it could limit lawmakers' ability to adopt deficit-financed fiscal policies to respond to unforeseen events or for other purposes,.
21910 21910 If there 's anything I 've learned, it 's that we can fix this world together ....
21913 21913 This increase is likely to be permanent.
21915 21915 and many who do go are n't paying much attention to their teachers ; those paying attention are the least likely to be ideologically indoctrinated.
21916 21916 Copper is the king of green metals if you want to clean the air,.
21920 21920 They wo n't bring back electric power any quicker when the lines go down if utility companies do n't have enough trucks and crew. And shortages of what we need -- not consumers and businesses unwilling to spend -- is the coronavirus economic challenge.
21921 21921 We really think if you treat people shabby enough, for long enough, bad things happen to them.
21923 21923 But, it should be good news for consumers because they should be paying less ( for those out-of-market live telecasts ).
21924 21924 Even if we generate Rs5 trillion with a 12 % tax-to-GDP ratio, the federal government has to give around Rs3 trillion to the provinces. So the federal government already starts with a deficit,.
21926 21926 Thank you President ! I think you are well orchestrating the compulsion of history and demand of destiny that we and India be the best of friends, joined at the hip and yet as family, free hearts and minds to love across a spectrum of emotions, but always together,.
21927 21927 The idea of using private insurance to cover some or all health-care costs -- instead of taxpayers paying for it -- has been pilloried in Canada for many years, but it 's a common feature of other universal health-care systems around the world,.
21928 21928 the results of public investments in the riskiest phase of drug research [ ... ] are accessible only to the private companies willing and able to deliver medicines needed by the public, at a cost the public can afford.
21930 21930 I think, in terms of levels, we 're kind of back to normal having absorbed the changes to B-20 and the higher levels of interest rates, et cetera.
21931 21931 The obvious advantage is that we can do it at the drop of a hat,.
21932 21932 There are significant measures happening today and next week which I think people should see as a co-ordinated and very powerful package,.
21935 21935 can not and should not incur massive leverage.
21937 21937 She considers that fashion is essential and should be exemplary, and she brings conviction and determination to promoting the circular economy.
21938 21938 Shutdowns applied in fragile ecosystems may turn out to be utterly ill-equipped. In the absence of a minimum revenue, the poor must quickly go out and look for work, which could reignite the contagion.
21942 21942 could cause immediate and irreparable damage to a competitive Australian air passenger transport industry.
21943 21943 Otherwise, they should be able to move to a cheaper plan with top speeds their connection can actually provide.
21947 21947 Because this merger has taken 18 months since that time, those payments have been done already, and that means that becomes part of the debt of the merged company, which is going to be roughly $ 4.5 billion for a company that will [ generate ] roughly $ 1.7 or $ 1.8 billion EBITDA. So the ratio increases slightly, but it 's still an investment-grade ratio.
21950 21950 Kaufland realised it was a game they could n't win in the short term -- they would have looked at ten years of losses.
21955 21955 If consumers do end up on higher-priced plans, but can not obtain the benefit of the promised speed boost, then they should be offered timely compensation in some form.
21956 21956 The first is democracy. One of the main problems we face today is [ decline in ] democracy. People can not be imprisoned because he has expressed his opinion. Any thought should be freely spoken at universities. The media must be independent,.
21959 21959 The more damage of that sort is done, the more likely we are to see a U, and there are worse letters, too, like L, and I hope we do n't see something like that.
21966 21966 I think we will see cases in Northern Ireland at some stage, which is why we are preparing for a range of eventualities - and will be ready to respond to those,.
21967 21967 So these measures may have to be ramped up and they may have to be scaled back at different points as we see how this virus progresses across Northern Ireland.
21969 21969 We may see it was the worst year in the history of global oil markets,.
21970 21970 Today will go down in history. The biggest-ever production cut has just been agreed upon by what can now be deemed the largest oil cartel in history,.
21971 21971 At such a time of uncertainty and potential vulnerability to the world economy ... playing Russian roulette with the oil markets may well have grave consequences,.
21974 21974 The impact of the coronavirus on oil markets may be temporary. But the longer-term challenges facing the world 's suppliers are not going to go away, especially those heavily dependent on oil and gas revenues. As the IEA has repeatedly said, these producer countries need more dynamic and diversified economies in order to navigate the multiple uncertainties that we see today.
21975 21975 When we look back on 2020 we may well see that it was the worst year ... April may well have been the worst month-it may go down as Black April,.
21978 21978 If the Trump administration and Congress ca n't get it together quickly and put together a sizable and responsible package, then a recession seems like a real possibility here,.
21979 21979 This revision is well-anticipated so likely wo n't impact financial markets, but it may change perceptions regarding the strength of the labor market.
21981 21981 The U.S. economy is more insulated from the impact of the virus, but it is not immune, and it too would likely suffer a downturn in this scenario,.
21982 21982 With weaker health systems to begin with, many face the dreadful challenge of fighting the virus in densely populated cities and poverty-stricken slums -- where social distancing is hardly an option. With fewer resources to begin with, they are dangerously exposed to the ongoing demand and supply shocks, drastic tightening in financial conditions, and some may face an unsustainable debt burden,.
21983 21983 recession at least as bad as during the global financial crisis or worse.
21991 21991 As a first line of defense, the Fund can deploy its flexible and rapid-disbursing emergency response toolkit to help countries with urgent balance-of-payment needs,.
21998 21998 The negative impact is especially visible where financial sectors are already very deep. Here, complicated financial instruments, influential lobbyists, and excessive compensation in the banking industry can lead to a system that serves itself as much as it serves others.
21999 21999 In most countries, the majority of workers are either self-employed or employed by the Small and Medium Enterprises. These businesses and workers are especially exposed.
22002 22002 Some estimates suggest the potential costs of devaluing these assets range from $ US4 trillion to $ US20 trillion.
22003 22003 And how can anyone expect, when the borders are open, that tourism is going to go back to where it was ?.
22005 22005 And my board said to me at the time, ` Fine, rabbi, but you 'll be lucky if 50 people show up.' And 175 people showed up.
22009 22009 An interest-rate cut certainly would n't be the right answer then,.
22010 22010 we should counteract any impressions and claims that we can fine-tune inflation to the decimal place -- we ca n't do that !.
22012 22012 To spell it out plainly : a child who hardly speaks or understands German has no place [ initially ] in a primary school,.
22013 22013 We are ready to work with others. It is premature to say more at the moment. But we are all one people, we can accommodate each other and forge a common front,.
22014 22014 We are waiting for judgement [ in the Constitutional Court ]. The EU should respect the courts and wait for the judgement. We have informed the EU in writing that we will not be attending the meeting.
22023 22023 It 's a very powerful thing. You do n't think a simple name, etched into glass can have an impact on you and I 've known this was going to be here for a while, but, definitely brings tears to your eyes and makes you proud of your son.
22024 22024 Insurers that will cover them do so as second-or third-line treatments, which means people will need to have tried at least two or three traditional treatment first,.
22026 22026 When there seems to be a big mistake in the Constitution or human rights, there will surely be reasons to protest,.
22027 22027 I am very worried and disturbed that the violence took place in the capital of the country. If minorities are tortured and police failed or could not discharge their duties, then it is a matter of serious concern,.
22031 22031 I am very much worried that where it happened is the capital of the country and is centrally governed. If minorities are tortured there and police failed or ca n't discharge their duties, it is a matter of serious concern,.
22035 22035 Before [ outgoing chair Charlie Mayfield ] left, he integrated the two businesses [ John Lewis & Partners and Waitrose & Partners ] as part of a cost-saving programme, but the company has realised it needs to find more ways of cutting costs. Perhaps it has been waiting for her to come on board to announce it.
22036 22036 Sadly, given recent announcements designed to help smaller retailers, no one in power seems to appreciate that it is the bigger retailers, the chains that are the big employers in the sector,.
22038 22038 can only tear each other apart.
22041 22041 As many of you will know, there is certain evidence I would have liked to have seen led in this trial but for a variety of reasons we were not able to do so. At some point, that information, that facts and that evidence will see the light of day.
22047 22047 It is gon na happen, believe you me-it 's gon na happen very f * * * ing soon because he 's greedy and he loves money and he knows that it 's got to happen soon or it wo n't happen.
22049 22049 What we saying, we having it or what.
22050 22050 It 's a shame and really sad that the group split up but while we are still alive there 's hope. Even if one of us is making stupid disco, at least one of us has stayed the same.
22056 22056 Once the infection rate stabilises, the number of cases is not rising, I think we 'll see Chinese ( economic ) stimulus,.
22057 22057 Lower interest rates have assisted with the process of household balance sheet adjustment. They have also boosted asset prices, which in time should lead to increased spending, including on residential construction,.
22059 22059 In fact, if December quarter growth turns out to be negative a recession may have already begun,.
22060 22060 if the unemployment rate were to be moving materially in the wrong direction and there was no further progress being made towards the inflation target, the balance of arguments would tilt towards a further easing of monetary policy.
22063 22063 This speaks to the underlying transmission of monetary policy and suggests that the effectiveness of monetary policy through the housing market is dependent on the state of the economy,.
22072 22072 The best way is to enable local forces to fight terrorism themselves, and that is exactly what we do in Afghanistan, what we do in Iraq, and of course we can look into if we can do more of that kind of activity.
22079 22079 could pave the way for a sustainable peace.
22081 22081 mirror what Russia does by deploying land-based missiles in Europe because a new arms race would be dangerous and expensive.
22087 22087 Some of that pain can be avoided if the government pumps cash into the economy,.
22088 22088 There are a million policies that would be better than this one,.
22092 22092 to cover one month 's wages for our part-time staff for games, concerts and events that they would have otherwise worked.
22094 22094 It 's been really interesting to sit in on these meetings and hear all of the different sides of it. The pros and cons and really try to understand where the league is at and what direction we 're headed. Whether if that is with a yes vote or a no vote.
22095 22095 This has been a whirlwind couple of hours for myself. I know how much a whirlwind it 's been for everybody here. I never thought I 'd become a general manager like this.
22098 22098 We can use that to complement the household savings that we have. Our household savings and the global capital could give the spur to investment that is required.
22099 22099 We do n't know exactly where and when it is going to peak but I think it is already starting to disrupt economic activities.
22102 22102 there is more that the central bank should consider doing as it helps Congress reduce the long-run effects of the downturn.
22103 22103 One way to increase the scope for monetary policy is to retain the Fed 's current focus on hitting a targeted value of inflation, but to raise the target to, say, 3 or 4 percent.
22107 22107 As the disease spreads and people become concerned about the potentiality of being sick, they will probably stock up.
22108 22108 Full time working from home is very isolating, so we could potentially see a rise of mental health issues around depression if large number of employees are forced to work from home for extended periods, particularly single and younger employees,.
22119 22119 I said, ` I just think we see the show differently ... and the world differently.
22120 22120 That was not a real form of the sadism of the Nazis, however, it 's very much in the spirit of the kinds of games and sadistic exploits that they would exact and perpetrate against their victims,.
22127 22127 that could prove large but will ultimately be temporary.
22128 22128 We would expect that interest rates are going to remain low for the foreseeable future and the adjustments will be relatively modest.
22131 22131 More supply needs to be built to change the price growth or at least stabilize it,.
22134 22134 If you look at December and January together, the housing market is doing quite well in terms of sales, but still being constrained by an inventory shortage pushing up prices too fast,.
22135 22135 Home prices and even rents are increasing too rapidly, and more inventory would help correct the problem and slow price gains.
22138 22138 Lego reached out to its customers and asked them to build designs with old Lego sets and put them online. If the design won more than 10,000 votes, it would be mass-produced by Lego.
22142 22142 Had we not suffered a supply disruption, our fourth-quarter numbers could be as strong as 4.3 per cent. And for the whole of the year, instead of the 4.3 per cent ... it could be as high as 4.7 per cent.
22147 22147 A regime of isolation is introduced for all age groups, with the exception of cases when emergency care is needed, or where you need to go to the store for food, or to travel to work [ ... ] and other really good reasons,.
22149 22149 Now it 's been added to the list of, especially dangerous illnesses. That will allow us to deport foreign citizens if they are diagnosed with such an illness,.
22150 22150 Mutualisation would make it possible to finance persistently large fiscal deficits without any risk of a debt crisis, and would send a positive political signal.
22152 22152 A lot of government spending will certainly be necessary, but the contours of that spending should be very different, because the circumstances are entirely different.
22154 22154 There is an element and a strong element of fans who have just gone right, if it 's not Bury it 's not nothing,.
22155 22155 We 're assuming much greater fiscal action will ameliorate the hit to earnings in due course, but we do n't know yet whether Congress will spend, say, 2 % of GDP or 10 %,.
22158 22158 We have whole industries like the restaurant industry that have been obliterated already. Jobless claims next week could be two or three million.
22159 22159 The trend in manufacturing output probably is about flat, with no real prospect of any serious improvement in the near term,.
22160 22160 But context matters. The U.S. now faces a massive deflationary shock, and the scale of the money-printing we think is likely to be necessary is no more than 10 % of GDP,.
22162 22162 We 're calling for those who can resolve their needs online to use those channels.
22167 22167 By doing so, we can reduce the import ( bill ) and start exporting ( our products ). This will create employment and increase the people 's income.
22170 22170 If anyone thinks that Momentum is going to go away -- dream on,.
22171 22171 it would be do n't stop at the first question. Ask many questions because there are about 13,000 people in the city, and seven get to ask difficult and insightful questions of the administration. Take advantage of that opportunity.
22173 22173 It 's likely investment was slowing in Australia and it was hard to meet the surplus in the budget,.
22175 22175 It is probably an approach where Australia has dropped its ideology and sought to do whatever it takes to get Australia through the pandemic,.
22177 22177 The 2019 growth projection has been revised up from 7.8 to 8.5 per cent, with strong upside risk -- especially given the recently released GDP figures suggesting that the economy grew in double digits in Q3 2019,.
22178 22178 [ T ] heir ire is often directed inward, and some expect -- and increasingly demand -- that our institutions act in ways that I fear may ultimately put us in tension with the essential values we represent to the world.
22181 22181 Following the devastating fires that have affected East Gippsland and north-east Victoria, the message is clear - the most practical thing that ordinary Victorians can do right now to help these regions is to travel there and spend money there,.
22186 22186 If India successfully achieves 10 % GDP for one decade at least, it will overtake China and challenge the US in the next 20 years,.
22187 22187 Our constitution is of Hindu Rashtra. There are sections for cow slaughter, giving encouragement to Sanskrit, Uniform Civil Code etc .. Only BJP can protect the integrity of this country,.
22188 22188 We must all work together to make sure that every Marylander is able to access resources to protect themselves from the coronavirus,.
22193 22193 When I was speaking with both the local motorbike store and the mechanics, both said they knew someone who wanted to get their licence but was putting it off because they go to Toowoomba, or Ipswich or Brisbane,.
22196 22196 We would like to secure funds for us before those losses are evaluated,.
22197 22197 a good indication they 've chosen to prioritise the correct things.
22198 22198 Moreover, the cash flow of the company should also be strong after paying interest. Companies having high debt-equity ratios may go bust in a single slowdown.
22199 22199 The Democrats did something no one else could have done -- they turned Donald Trump into a victim. He may still be angry with her, but [ Pelosi ] made his current popularity possible.
22208 22208 America basically had a property-rights regime that meant that anyone who had a plot of land could pretty much put up anything reasonable on that plot of land.
22213 22213 the flattest Davos I can remember.
22214 22214 There is nothing else left to do on the monetary side ( his emphasis ). No one should expect that the monetary stimulus will fix things. It will help some, and may put a floor under inflation and interest rates. But fiscal stimulus and direct help for affected sectors is necessary to get recovery.
22215 22215 We have a programme with the central bank to surrender coins in exchange for notes, and I must say that premiums on EcoCash are unacceptable, but the issue is because there is not enough domestic cash yet,.
22218 22218 A growth slowdown in China could have sizable ripple effects across Asia and the rest of the world, given the size of China 's economy and its role as the key driver of global growth in recent years,.
22225 22225 will undoubtedly trouble many church members and lead them to wonder whether their charitable giving is best directed toward an institution that reportedly has a stockpile twice as large as Harvard 's endowment.
22228 22228 Most likely, because they ( students ) were on forced vacation due to tragedies like ( the eruption of ) Taal ( volcano ).
22234 22234 I think better surveillance systems are one of the keys in future pandemics and outbreaks,.
22237 22237 if the pandemic and containment measures last longer, emerging and developing economies are even more severely hit, tight financial conditions persist, or if widespread scarring effects emerge due to firm closures and extended unemployment,.
22238 22238 and maybe even likely.
22239 22239 Much worse growth outcomes are possible and maybe even likely,.
22240 22240 There are preliminary signs that the decline in manufacturing and trade may be bottoming out. This is partly from an improvement in the auto sector as disruptions from new emission standards start to fade. A US-China Phase I deal, if durable, is expected to reduce the cumulative negative impact of trade tensions on global GDP by end 2020-from 0.8 percent to 0.5 percent,.
22241 22241 The first priority is to deal with the health crisis of the pandemic ... countries will have to continue spending on health care infrastructure to ensure even if there is a second wave you have the health system to take care of it,.
22242 22242 The most major issue to address is the weakness in credit growth. There need to be policies that can resuscitate credit growth but at the same time do n't create further NPA problems - that is the first step. There needs to be a quicker recapitalisation of banks,.
22244 22244 to indulge in a kind of cheerleading frenzy to pile on to a narrative that is evidence of either virtue signaling ... or just a kind of crass partisan our side versus their side and we 're gon na win.
22246 22246 As far as a formal process, we do that with all of our employees here at the city and the city manager should be no different.
22253 22253 Despite the damage to tourism and the drought, among other problems that slowed investment and created uncertainty, the economy grew 5.1 % and that, we Dominicans must display it with pride in international markets,.
22260 22260 This all needs to be dealt with before [ ECOWAS ] can move forward,.
22263 22263 what sadly links the laid-off white Rust Belt worker in his 50s to the low-income minority youth from a dysfunctional school and economically disadvantaged community is the dignity hit of feeling denied a real chance to pursue his or her full potential and purpose.
22265 22265 From a delivery standpoint, we had made some changes. Normally we would hand a table to our customers to sign their name. Now with the customer present, the carrier will sign their name in front of them. Once that 's completed they will safely put the package down and step away, so the customer can retrieve the package,.
22274 22274 support the government and the National Centre for Disease Control ( NCDC ) by providing facilities that can serve as both testing and isolation centres.
22276 22276 But more importantly, we can have a communion where family members both young and old can come together, have fun, do great exercise and enjoy themselves and also make money out of it.
22277 22277 That 's just not likely to happen in the future.
22278 22278 There have been times on Vikings or something where I would really want to do a stunt, but a stunty would say, ` Yeah, dude, I really want this adjustment.' And I 'd be like, ` No problem, you take it.
22283 22283 I think I can do some good with that, and it 's also very profitable. So I like my day job.
22284 22284 I also wanted to shout from the rooftops about the importance of taking the virus seriously so that we would build a consensus to lockdown the country as soon as possible,.
22287 22287 the height of irresponsibility for this administration to finalize a rollback that will lead to dirtier air while our country is working around the clock to respond to a respiratory pandemic whose effects may be exacerbated by air pollution.
22288 22288 Having seen the perils of communism firsthand, I hope we can find common ground in working against the socialist-aligned policies that some of his Democrat colleagues are unfortunately embracing.
22291 22291 We see several reasons why standard models -- and thus forecasters -- may be overestimating recession risk at present. The 24 % chance for a recession within 12 months remains below the probability estimates of the median forecaster and reinforces our view that the risk of recession remains moderate.
22292 22292 Both the prediction markets and the head-to-head matchups -- even those involving candidates other than [ former Vice President Joe ] Biden -- indicate a considerably closer runoff in November than suggested by the widespread view among investors that President Trump is a shoo-in for re-election,.
22296 22296 hopeful that this suggests that the publisher is ready to discuss deals that align with UC 's goals.
22299 22299 Should we ignore the data on the relationship between subway ridership and the spread of coronavirus because definitive proof has not been established ? And then run the risk that the ` renormalization' will end up with a second wave ? I did not think so at the time I posted this article at midnight on Monday morning, and I do n't think so now. And that goes double.
22301 22301 This year we have extended our existing IT apprenticeship scheme ( level 3 ) to encompass an element of AV for the first time to explore what an AV apprenticeship should look like in future. While we 're looking to give all the IT apprentices an introduction to AV, two members of the current cohort have a more extensive AV element, reporting to me.
22306 22306 We are committed to remaining in the market to stabilize the rupiah by selling dollars as cash or domestic non-deliverable forwards,.
22308 22308 We would like to ensure that no African is left behind and develop to ensure that there is prosperity for all, that we create jobs for both the youth and the women,.
22311 22311 Yes, it means higher deficit and higher debt, and yes it means we will have to finance it over time, over the years. But if we do n't take this measure, the effect on the economy will be even more devastating. And I think the cost of that will be huge.
22315 22315 The problem with finance research is it looks for an effect or factor that is significant statistically. The usual rule is 95 per cent confidence which is two standard deviations. However that only applies to a single test,.
22317 22317 a single 10 % rate applied on 70 % of the economy yields 7 % of GDP as tax revenues and even if we actually obtain a part of this, we are broadly okay.
22321 22321 But the tenants whose lives are being destroyed and whom this amendment would not help -- that 's very real,.
22327 22327 The traditional view of where employers can find workers, however, leaves out some important things,.
22330 22330 We must not let this debate devolve into one about the character of Julian Assange -- he is an Australian citizen, a journalist, and urgently requires Government intervention.
22332 22332 We 've listened to small businesses to understand how we can best help them,.
22333 22333 It seems to me that many women take charge of their lives in every way except dating and marriage. I mean dating between men and women. Same-sex couples are n't bound by the idea that one gender should propose.
22335 22335 It 's like we want Prince Charming on a white horse. We 're taught gender stereotypes : men are supposed to sweep us off our feet.
22342 22342 We seem to be having a bit of an issue in getting the stock up to the $ 70 range,.
22346 22346 changing the paradigm for scientific investigation. Without the data platform, we would not have had the statistical power to run an analysis on all possible diseases.
22352 22352 I would want to be that mentor figure to someone else.
22353 22353 You want them ( stakeholders ) to be with you, not fighting with you and that involves some outreach, but also PCORI should recognize that doing so distracts from what your real mission is, which is research.
22354 22354 I would n't put it that way because we 're pretty murderous also,.
22358 22358 We should n't be doing that -- our financial investments in the fossil fuels are actually ensuring that we 're contributing to global warming and the climate crisis,.
22362 22362 There actually is a great deal of banking fraud that the industry absorbs every year in order to conduct business. But I think any amount of voter or election fraud can potentially call into question the results of an election,.
22366 22366 We make sure we protect ourselves as much as we can but this is a very personal service.
22370 22370 The worst suffering could be for informal workers, people who are ... invisible and very hard to go identify, find, and help,.
22371 22371 This is a serious concern because not only does the lockdown keep people from going to work, it keeps them at home which is not necessarily that pristine isolated place but can also be a slum where people live together,.
22378 22378 The macroeconomic policies are not where they should be, structural policies are not where they should be,.
22388 22388 But even more important [ than suppressing information ] ... is the question of the attention given to a fact -- its placement, tone, and repetitions, the framework of analysis within which it is presented, and the related facts that accompany it and give it meaning ( or preclude understanding ).
22394 22394 I think a lot of people 's heads were not yet in the magnitude of the economic problem that coronavirus was going to pose,.
22399 22399 But obviously, there are a number of convergence criteria that would have to be met and I am sure that our President is talking with other presidents to be sure that they can meet those criteria and the region can be fully integrated,.
22400 22400 I just think injuries happen. We 've had more than our share this year, but we have to build a team that can handle it.
22401 22401 As in all episodes of panic, one of the greatest risks is governments that feel the need to do something quick and massive, probably contributing to that same panic that they call to mitigate. Taking unnecessary interventionist measures, closing the economy, and disguising the risk with bricks and mortar may be even worse as a solution than the problem itself.
22403 22403 zero or even negative.
22406 22406 So rational spectrum allocation would ensure a kind of stability going forward,.
22411 22411 should be showing up on the dashboard much more than it is.
22414 22414 They were very enthusiastic ; I would love to do this again.
22417 22417 This puts them in a very difficult situation : either you have to continue working and expose [ yourself ] or you try to survive without a steady source of income,.
22418 22418 I think that 's probably pretty normal, but it 's useful once in a while to sit back and reflect on where we are and where we 're going.
22419 22419 If there is strong evidence for how we can promote our children 's wellbeing, we should be doing it,.
22423 22423 But our movement is moving forward with its grassroots ballot initiative if City Council fails to enact a strong Amazon Tax.
22426 22426 It is pretty safe to move around here in Malaysia and domestic tourism would certainly cushion the outbreak 's impact to our economy,.
22430 22430 A major policy error could do serious damage. Fortunately, monetary and fiscal policy have made a pretty good start in the last four weeks.
22431 22431 Italy needs to reduce the spread of the virus to a speed the health system can cope with, and that does not appear to be the case yet.
22435 22435 Lenders might think this is a good profit opportunity, assuming borrowers do n't care about a few basis points. Another reason would be for lenders to close the gates on customers as more people want to refinance and they do n't have the resources to manage an influx of new loans. And the third possible reason is the future of Fannie and Freddie 's government guarantee.
22437 22437 Numbers in the coming weeks will show just how hard the housing market was hit, but I am optimistic that the upcoming stimulus package will lessen the economic damage and we may get a ` V-shaped' robust recovery later in the year.
22438 22438 Home values will stay on much firmer ground if we go into a recession,.
22442 22442 It is a global norm and we will not be the first to do that. Uniformed forces have such shops in cantonment areas as part of their service benefits. For the teachers, there are silo shops and there must be subsidised. These shops have not been rolled out fast enough for teachers, nurses but it will with time,.
22444 22444 We have our own projection of 3 %, so you can see that generally there is a feeling that this will be a better year. So we are sticking to our 3 % rate of growth,.
22449 22449 Clearly we have seen a rise in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. We still have to see how far this goes. If you look at the response of markets and if you look at oil prices the reaction has been fairly muted at this point,.
22450 22450 No .. I do n't think I know a single macroeconomist who thinks that this was a good idea. And, it 's not something I think should be done for a country such as India and the level of development it has,.
22456 22456 The second is the importance of having strong social safety nets that can be triggered automatically ... in the sense that countries have strong unemployment insurance schemes, that can provide cash transfers much more quickly ... those are the ones able to respond to needs much faster and I can see a world where everybody goes more towards this type of automatic transfer system.
22457 22457 There can not be a tiny possibility that you would not be a zone the way it is now in the future,.
22459 22459 should come from the monetary stimulus that has been put in the system and some of it from the corporate tax cut,.
22460 22460 We need to think, what are we celebrating. Are we aware of the systems around us ?.
22461 22461 It is a good move as the main shock at such a time experienced by the economy is insufficient cash flows. It impacts enterprises as they are concerned about when they can pay back. Not having to pay at this time is the right thing,.
22469 22469 Any evaluation of digital currencies should consider both policy and business objectives, as well as the unique circumstances that face different economies around the world, in order to fully evaluate their risks and benefits,.
22470 22470 Pollution is mainly due to stubble burning and weather conditions. If it is due to construction, then why is air quality not improving after stopping construction ?.
22472 22472 Prior to the referendum, the MPC expected that a vote to leave would prompt the exchange rate to fall sharply, inflation to rise above the 2 % target, and growth to slow materially. That is exactly what happened.
22474 22474 This could turn an existential risk into the greatest commercial opportunity of our time.
22475 22475 If evidence builds that weakness in activity could persist, risk management considerations would favour a relatively prompt response.
22480 22480 a central bank-supported digital currency could replace the dollar as the global hedge currency.
22482 22482 the Canadian oil and gas industry has long been at the centre of the debate about financial institutions and climate change, thanks in part to major European banks such as HSBC Plc and BNP Paribas announcing they would not invest in new projects in the oilsands. Large pension funds in Europe and North America have also signalled plans to divest their holdings in heavy oil companies -- moves which have hurt the Calgary oilpatch.
22490 22490 GDP growth in the March quarter is likely to be noticeably weaker than earlier expected,.
22493 22493 I think it 's an agenda the current U.S. administration has been planning for some time, and they 're using the guise of COVID-19 to ram it through. It is clearly a counterproductive measure.
22494 22494 They have a system in place so families fan pull up in cars and food can be placed in their trunks,.
22498 22498 We can support Afghans, we can help them, but we can not negotiate peace for them. They have to do that themselves, and they want to do it themselves.
22499 22499 President Trump has expressed a clear wish for more support from NATO. We have a good dialogue among NATO allies and, of course, also with the countries concerned, for instance, Iraq, on how we can do this, how we can do more.
22502 22502 I strongly believe that if we do n't act now we may be forced back in combat,.
22504 22504 We will try to do whatever we can to find a way to solve this issue because it' s one of the issues that has created problems inside the alliance. There' s no way to deny that.
22506 22506 We 've got a curveball with this coronavirus. I think that 's a big deal. If you look at what happened in 2003, estimates ranged 0.5 % to 2 % in GDP for China, half a percent for Southeast Asia. Stock markets sold off double digits. If you look at the escalation of the reported cases, it feels a lot like that.
22508 22508 All those folks who have jobs that require face-to-face contact, many jobs in services, there 's no demand for that work right now and quite frankly it can be dangerous for folks to do those jobs,.
22510 22510 watch a drama on Netflix or something like that,.
22511 22511 In times of crisis such as at present, foreign exchange interventions and capital flow management measures can usefully complement interest rate and other monetary policy actions,.
22512 22512 This is especially true for retail, hospitality, transport, and tourism. In most countries, the majority of workers are either self-employed or employed by small and medium-sized enterprises. These businesses and workers are especially exposed.
22513 22513 With fewer resources to begin with, they are dangerously exposed to the ongoing demand and supply shocks, drastic tightening in financial conditions, and some may face an unsustainable debt burden.
22516 22516 Then it was 8 percent of the world economy. Now it is 19 percent and it is much more integrated in Asia and with the rest of the world. Therefore, disruptions are more likely to cascade down to other countries,.
22517 22517 too often we overlook the financial sector, which can also have a profound and long-lasting positive or negative effect on inequality.
22518 22518 In fact, there may be a sizeable rebound, but only if we succeed with containing the virus everywhere and prevent liquidity problems from becoming a solvency issue,.
22527 22527 I keep out anything that would have carbs in it,.
22528 22528 Provinces have actually been doing this for a very long time, so for the feds to come into the game of promoting local foods all of a sudden could actually create some confusion.
22529 22529 A lot of trucking companies are getting more contracts, so there could be shortages in terms of capacity for trucking. And obviously, with Ontario [ having ] 14 million people to feed versus a few million in the Maritimes, economics could actually play against us.
22532 22532 What followed was decades of environmental progress that went hand in hand with public participation in project planning and the federal decision-making process. For countless American communities, the law has served as a bulwark against projects and other activities that could harm the environment, human health or quality of life.
22533 22533 I 'm concerned about this collusion whether it 's intentional or unintentional between the Russians and the South Carolina Republicans to support Senator Sanders,.
22537 22537 Those quarters might be boom quarters,.
22550 22550 It would be insane to do anything like that. Her claims are a fabrication from start to finish.
22552 22552 I think over the passage of time the incident is misremembered,.
22559 22559 no business can survive 18 months without revenue.
22563 22563 This appears intended as a broad signal to U.S. trading partner countries that any significant weakening of their currencies relative to the dollar could invite retaliatory actions,.
22564 22564 You ca n't win. If you overdo it, you panic everybody. If you underdo it, they get complacent.
22568 22568 We do n't know yet whether Congress will spend, say, 2 % of GDP or 10 %. We hope for the latter, but given that the very modest first-stage House bill has not yet passed the Senate, it 's hard to be wildly optimistic,.
22570 22570 Utility output is now well below trend and a huge rebound will come when temperatures revert to seasonal norms, but note for now that the Jan decline likely constrained real consumers' spending last month. People do n't realize in real-time that they have saved money when winter temperatures are warmer than usual, so the drop in real spending on utility energy will not immediately be offset by gains elsewhere,.
22571 22571 We reckon May payrolls will be reported falling by about 19M, driving the unemployment rate to 16 % if none of the newly-unemployed leave the labor force. That seems unlikely, given that the labor force reportedly dropped by 1.6 M in March, when household employment fell by 3.0 M.
22572 22572 It looks to me like the order of magnitude in most states seems to be about 10 times higher than the normal weekly numbers before the crisis,.
22573 22573 The manufacturing losses in January were offset by above-trend increases in business services and healthcare, and a 44K leap in construction, likely thanks to the exceptionally mild winter across much of the country and the clear upturn in the housing market. Looking ahead, surveys continue to point to substantially slower payroll growth, but the hard data have outperformed substantially in recent months and show no signs yet of fading. Even so, January 's jump in payrolls likely will be followed by a significantly smaller increase in February, as favourable weather effects fade and healthcare job growth mean-reverts,.
22574 22574 We expect the outbreak to be over by the end of May, and perhaps much earlier than that,.
22577 22577 It does seem that dollar signs have the ability to blind federal politicians, local councils, Australian investors to doing what they should do, and that is ask questions -- hard questions -- about these investors.
22583 22583 Governments can use the current situation to step up their climate ambitions and launch sustainable stimulus packages focused on clean energy technologies. Rather than compounding the tragedy by allowing it to hinder clean energy transitions, we need to seize the opportunity to help accelerate them,.
22584 22584 Yet there is no guarantee that buyers will emerge out of the woodwork even if OPEC + further tightens the oil spigots,.
22587 22587 The ECB is willing to do anything to help absolutely everyone in the EU. In my view that is a strong statement that should help to stabilise the markets,.
22591 22591 Africa should n't be in a situation wherein it is begging,.
22592 22592 no one is recommending the use of such policies in ordinary times ; it 's precisely in the most difficult or extreme circumstances, in which other monetary and fiscal tools might be unavailable or ineffective, that MFFPs might be considered.
22593 22593 in the face of an economic downturn or undesirably low inflation, the room available for conventional rate cuts is much smaller than in the past.
22599 22599 We try to never engineer something. I think the best things just happen and afterwards have a positive impact.
22602 22602 The underlying assumption is that those big challenges -- environmental ... poverty -- can not be solved by governments alone, or by business alone, or by civil society. You need co-operation,.
22606 22606 Now, as the global economy is slowing down due to the pandemic, our exports are also likely to be impacted and our foreign remittances are also likely to be reduced,.
22616 22616 Recent disappointing economic data have raised expectations that the Bank of England could well cut rates this week from 0.75 per cent to 0.5 per cent, over concerns that the slowdown in economic data seen at the end of 2019 has spilled into the early part of this year,.
22621 22621 We are positive on India for the long term. We believe it is the right price to invest in India and will continue to add positions in India if an opportunity presents itself,.
22624 22624 They think the longer this ( the protest ) stays, the more will be the polarisation .... They are hoping it would work in Bengal. The next big target is Bengal.
22628 22628 We think of a depression as a recession that is very, very deep and very, very long,.
22629 22629 With funding stresses likely eased, focus will likely shift to the large size of the Fed balance sheet expansion, increase in fiscal deficits in DM economies as well as issues around the sustainability of the European monetary union. We believe this will likely lead to debasement concerns similar to the post GFC period,.
22632 22632 The air is a combination of fresh air and recirculated air, about half each. The recirculated air goes through filters of the exact same type that we use in surgical operating theaters. That supplied air is guaranteed to be 99.97 % ( or better ) free of viruses and other particles.
22639 22639 Consumers paid a premium for floor-level seats, ranging between $ 895 and $ 3995 for a hospitality package and may have done so as a result of misleading seating advertising,.
22640 22640 Providing financial relief for policy holders during this pandemic is an important and welcome measure. We are also pleased to see moves to cover tele-health consultations, so that policyholders can still safely consult health professionals,.
22647 22647 It is about putting particular segments of society in the position that they would have been in but for some undeserved misfortune.
22650 22650 We estimate that in MENA, increasing female labour force participation to the levels of men could boost regional GDP by 47 percent,.
22652 22652 We have a lot of young people entering the labor force. We need to provide jobs for them and even if much of the growth is job-oriented, 5 % simply does n't cut it,.
22653 22653 This forecast includes the immediate tax cut that the new government put into place ... conservatively on the order of 0.1 percentage points on growth. It 's probably a little bit more than that, but I want to put a number against it because it 's a targeted tax cut as opposed to just a general fiscal stimulus.
22654 22654 We believe all this will be temporary but can be prolonged if confidence is unduly damaged. And so these actions are meant to buttress that confidence and give us a bridge across the trouble,.
22655 22655 We suspect that they view the impact of a coordinated move on confidence as greater than the sum of the impacts of each individual move.
22656 22656 This dysfunction has created new economic risks arising from events such as shutdowns and debt ceiling fights that can have substantial effects on financial conditions and growth.
22657 22657 As an economist I say unequivocally : Legislation aimed at cutting the number of workdays would significantly cut GDP and household income, and would mainly hurt people with incomes below the median,.
22659 22659 If we 're looking at four weeks, it 's a hurricane. But to be clear, if this goes 40 weeks, California is not in a good position .... Our revenue system in the state is so hypersensitive to shifts in capital gains that if the stock market really did stay down where it is right now, we 're going to take a massive hit.
22675 22675 In all my years of doing public policy research, I 've never seen a plan where the funding mechanism could impact it this dramatically.
22676 22676 The type of annuities that economists like, including myself ... is what 's called fixed annuities, or true lifetime income annuities. And those were already allowed in 401 ( k ) plans. This is just going to open up a door to considerable abuse.
22682 22682 We can afford to increase federal spending and cut taxes.
22683 22683 I would be in favour of asking banks to suspend dividends and stock buybacks,.
22686 22686 But as it goes out, we know already that the acceleration of the pace of this virus, and this assault -- not only on the lives but the livelihood of the American people -- that we must do more. So we 're preparing for CARES 2 already.
22687 22687 If we stake out positions in advance of meetings and we have already decided that it does n't matter what our colleagues have to say, there is no real reason for us to meet at all. We could save travel expenses by phoning in our votes.
22688 22688 But I do think that because these jobs are so irregular, some kind of direct government income support is going to be needed. Maybe it would be some kind of tax holiday for individuals. It could take any number of forms, and I do n't think it 's especially important what exact form it takes. What 's important is that Washington moves now and gets that money flowing.
22693 22693 I intend to retire as solo artist after album number three as I have just had a call from my brother begging me to start Oasis again in 2022 if you believe in life after love c 'm on you know ( SIC ).
22694 22694 Listen seriously a lot of people think I 'm a * * * * and I am a good looking * * * * but once this is put to bed we need to get oasis back for a 1 of gig rite for charity c'mon Noel we can then go back to our amazing solo careers c'mon you know LG x ( sic ).
22696 22696 Sorry to everybody who came to the gig tnight in Hamburg my voice was not there and if I 'd have carried on I 'd have done more damage to it I love you all and hope you understand I 'll make it up to you LG x.
22698 22698 My current view on this is I think they 're actually being genuine,.
22700 22700 The CAA law that has been passed in my judgment should be turned down by the Supreme Court on the grounds of it being unconstitutional because you can not have certain types of fundamental human rights linking citizenship with religious differences,.
22701 22701 I think the CAA must be scrapped because it can not be an Act ... That 's the job of the Supreme Court to see whether what was passed in the Parliament can be legally attached to the Constitution,.
22702 22702 I am very much worried that where it happened in the capital of the country and is centrally governed. If minorities are tortured there and police failed or ca n't discharge their duties, it is a matter of serious concern,.
22703 22703 The playbook story in these events is that the Fed would always be a provider of liquidity as needed,.
22705 22705 I suspect we are already in a recession,.
22706 22706 We do n't know what the long run sensitivity is I do n't think.
22710 22710 They have no way to feed their children if they do n't draw a paycheck every single week.
22711 22711 They moved away from the idea of, How do we make our current workforce more productive ? and to, How do we move workers off our payroll and onto a contract company ? And then they can do whatever they want with the workers,.
22712 22712 This is a negative supply shock which reduces growth, increases cost and inflation. Monetary policy can affect demand shocks and its impact on negative supply shocks will be on income-positive as soon as you know the Fed is going to act but it 's going to fizzle out over time,.
22719 22719 I do think we 're going to see exemptions for shelter in place, as we move to the end of the month, and then some openings in May,.
22721 22721 Under any scenario, if we get a good stimulus package, I still think it 's a big hit. It 's hard to gauge but my guess is we 'll be down 2 % to 3 % in Q1 and around the same in Q2, assuming we get a lot of fiscal stimulus,.
22723 22723 If, on the other hand, we are wrong, then we call upon Hollub and Batchelder to publicly and clearly state whether or not OXY was approached as a possible acquisition target ? It 's a very simple question -- one that management should address on the February earnings call.
22726 22726 If this leads to overall efficiency gains, either because large online firms such are more productive, or because retailers such as supermarkets are able to more efficiently serve consumers using online services, then this effect could weigh on retail unit wage costs and on CPI inflation for as long as these trends in consumer behaviour persist.
22727 22727 It would be in keeping with its historical mandate if the Fed were to pursue a more co-ordinated relationship with both Congress and the president,.
22728 22728 I would not advocate going back to prior historical monetary arrangement,.
22729 22729 would be in keeping with its historical mandate if the Fed were to pursue a more coordinated relationship with both Congress and the President.
22744 22744 is that it is not realistic to expect it to go away in two months, and that if it did, it could come back even more virulently again in the flu season next year.
22745 22745 For some people, that would enable them not to work,.
22748 22748 The police do n't police. The regulators do n't regulate. But the one thing that I can do is to research.
22749 22749 But our debt is on an unsustainable path and over time, we must address this fiscal challenge.
22753 22753 Political scientists would feel totally free to ignore what economists were writing if what economists were writing today was n't of interest to them,.
22756 22756 African debt to China is $ 145bn or so, over $ 8bn of payments is required this year ... So that needs to be looked at.
22757 22757 what you did in December ( raking in more revenue to exceed the target ) was quiet clear that we can do greater things ... I know you can do it.
22758 22758 Everything depends on how long it lasts, but if this goes on for a long time, it 's certainly going to be the mother of all financial crises.
22760 22760 all federal executive bodies to refrain from work trips or cancel them.
22762 22762 may result in near-zero interest rates at long maturities, bringing U.S experience closer to that seen in Europe and Japan.
22769 22769 It would be an agreement whose principles are established and we can see how it works as we go along, with Barnier taking out the necessary insurance against British dumping,.
22770 22770 It 's too soon to know how cash flows will be deployed when the nation 's corporations are once again generating revenues, profits and cash. Rehiring workers should be the top priority,.
22771 22771 People who are not in a way fully employed -- driving a little bit for Uber on the side. They might still be available to take a real job if one becomes available.
22775 22775 There are a few areas where this emergency is starting to lead to real progress, like on paid sick leave where they seem to be trying to cover not formal employees, but those who are counted rightly or wrongly as contractors or self-employed,.
22780 22780 By exploiting vulnerabilities in human psychology selectively bred by its pathogen ancestors, it has already shut down many of our schools, crashed our stock market, increased social conflict and xenophobia, reshuffled our migration patterns, and is working to contain us in homogenous spaces where it can keep spreading.
22781 22781 Early on, I thought they competed,.
22786 22786 It would certainly have very significant negative implications.
22787 22787 If you ask me today who wins Iowa, I ca n't tell you. Who wins New Hampshire, I ca n't tell you -- and that 's my job,.
22790 22790 With the discussions between Saudi Arabia and Russia that started, in essence, a price war, somewhat. And then, I do n't think anyone planned for a global pandemic to come along and crash the entire global economy as well.
22792 22792 And I must say that the standard keeps getting better each year. All our winners deserve the accolades they have taken home today.
22793 22793 My feeling is that five to seven years from now, it 'll be as if the virus never happened.
22795 22795 the use of vouchers or some form of credit note for customer refunds in a way that does not materially erode consumer rights.
22800 22800 [ Henry ] and I think if we had 30 minutes with Trump in the Oval Office, it would be a done deal,.
22801 22801 They want nearly ready major league talent at the level of a Gleyber Torres type or close and there is no chance a team is going to give them a package of those caliber of players.
22807 22807 ... if they have changed the name of accused from Muslim in real life to a Hindu name. That is defamation.
22808 22808 For sure, as we wait to read the finer detail, any large scale extra money will come at the price of accountability and control - this is probably inevitable and a good thing too.
22811 22811 Perhaps the most important issue is that women are working where jobs are growing. Health care added more jobs in 2019 than 2018, while jobs grow slowed substantially in mining, construction, transportation & warehousing, and construction,.
22812 22812 I think one of the challenges for men is we need to see more cultural images that reshape our notions of traditionally female jobs as actually being jobs that are more gender-neutral and more consistent with masculinity,.
22817 22817 The first thing is that you make sure that the central bank provides plenty of liquidity to banks so that banks can provide liquidity to their customers,.
22818 22818 You know we just ran the numbers ... carefully over the weekend, and we think the second quarter is going to me minus 5 %, and we think the jobs number in early April might me as much as minus a million or so, because ... nobody 's going to get hired next week.
22822 22822 Our stress test can give us insight into where capital should be needed,.
22823 22823 This would have preserved the option of a further cut in the funds rate, if needed, for a time when market functioning had improved and such an action could be expected to be most effective in supporting the economy as it emerges from the health crisis after the medical response has been put in place, new cases of the virus have begun to stabilize, social distancing has eased and life begins to return to some semblance of normal.
22825 22825 We can save about four to six weeks by not going to our board,.
22827 22827 The reality is when ( President Barack ) Obama offered only tepid support to Iranian protesters in 2009, the regime still called them American agents and crushed them. If the Trump administration offers more enthusiastic support, the regime will call them American agents and attempt to crush them,.
22830 22830 We demand here and today that they, together with Chief Elections Officer and all key senior management, should immediately resign and vacate their offices. They deserve no single day, hour or minute in any public office in this land,.
22833 22833 The Singularity has happened ; we call it ` the industrial revolution' or ` the long nineteenth century.' It was over by the close of 1918. Exponential yet basically unpredictable growth of technology, rendering long-term extrapolation impossible ( even when attempted by geniuses ) Check. Massive, profoundly dis-orienting transformation in the life of humanity, extending to our ecology, mentality and social organization ? Check. Annihilation of the age-old constraints of space and time ? Check.
22835 22835 I think anybody would want to do that. And probably in the next month or so, we 're going to get together as an organization and just discuss things.
22840 22840 I do n't think the Government can assume that this will be the only industry or the only example of large firms that may need public money to support them through the difficult economic times ahead,.
22842 22842 In what could be one of the biggest celebrity divorce settlements in British history,.
22843 22843 Relief is slow coming for bills due now, people are falling through government eligibility cracks, and too much of the relief is in the form of deferrals and loans, which just adds to the fear of coming out of this crisis with a mountain of debt that will be difficult or impossible to repay.
22849 22849 So you can indulge yourselves with a study of what it would be like if there were no taxes-but the reality is unfortunately much harsher.
22851 22851 They deserve hazardous duty pay. They deserve us to stand up and salute .... The idea that they do n't have sick pay or that somehow their income is going to be cut is immoral.
22853 22853 Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) is still work in progress. GST was supposed to be revenue-neutral. But the government has lost revenue post-GST implementation, which is not tenable,.
22855 22855 Once people get used to grocery deliveries, for example, I do n't think they 'll go back,.
22857 22857 Hang in there while you can.
22860 22860 If the regulator has approved it, the federal cabinet has approved it, I mean, surely that should signal to people that that 's an approval,.
22861 22861 Prime Minister Johnson warned that if the EC denies it the Canadian-like agreement, the UK will walk away from talks at the end of Q2. The EC negotiators have made it clear that such a deal with the UK would require regulatory alignment, which the UK can not accept. This issue is to the trade talks that Ireland was to the divorce agreement, nearly impossible to resolve without transgressing redlines of one side or the other,.
22862 22862 Some people actually did want or need to buy new cars ... but they could n't because they did n't have enough cash -- and they could n't get a loan or a lease agreement either, because the financing institutions that would normally make these agreements were also constrained in the crisis.
22863 22863 We had a lucky escape yesterday, we may not be so lucky next time.
22864 22864 What we really care about is stuff like people 's movements, and how social distancing is working. And there 's incredible data available now, if you know how to use it.
22867 22867 For a cyclical revival you have to look at the demand side and I do n't think the actions taken so far will actually have the impact that is expected on the demand side.
22869 22869 It 's proof that people can have different politics and still love each other at the end of the day,.
22871 22871 My one reservation is that if we 're going to have free trade agreements [ with countries ] like the States, [ the Government ] has got to make it worthwhile insofar as if they want to export stuff to us,.
22872 22872 The fake message had been translated into several languages and appears to indicate that avoiding ice cream and other old foods can prevent the onset of the disease,.
22875 22875 Wealth taxes often failed in Europe. They would n't here,.
22876 22876 If you aggregate all of those incentives, in both directions, it 's about $ -5 per ton,.
22878 22878 The test would be cheap or free at doctors office or clinic.
22880 22880 The goal we are working toward is to see this kind of improvement in August, but you ca n't retain students in the fall if you do n't retain them in the spring, so this is exciting news.
22883 22883 The US could have followed the lead of several major European countries and offered job retention programmes, paying most of people 's salaries, but preferred instead to increase and extend unemployment benefits. The result will be even greater dislocation for both people and businesses, some of which could have been avoided, and probably at a relatively small incremental cost,.
22884 22884 We would n't be at all surprised to see new cycle highs over the next couple of months,.
22889 22889 They can improve things in their annual reports for 2019,.
22891 22891 what I would recommend is re-thinking the social safety net and having it less tightly coupled with the kind of job you 're doing,.
22892 22892 And if the businesses have declared bankruptcy, they wo n't be there for them to spend their money at.
22893 22893 196 million people have been urged to stay home. Not all employers can keep paying them,.
22894 22894 Canadians are slowly looking at options. I think the four per cent is indicative of the fact that people are starting to process the idea that maybe there are other ways to buy food, and not just showing up physically at a store.
22896 22896 If you do n't think about food security very seriously, the entire agri-foods system in Canada becomes highly vulnerable.
22897 22897 ` How do we download an app, and how do you use an app to order food, and what about e-commerce ?' And ` How comfortable am I to allow someone I do n't know to pick and choose the food that I 'm going to buy ?' There are all of these things that are probably going to be processed in consumers' minds over the next little while,.
22901 22901 Congress must quickly design a more forceful response to the crisis.
22902 22902 Cutting production, 1.5-million barrels a day in April or May, is not really going to save you in the current environment,.
22903 22903 I wish in hindsight I 'd just screamed or kicked him in the nuts, but I was so frozen. I was panicking inside.
22904 22904 Everyone in the world wants those same reagents, and the suppliers can only supply a certain amount,.
22907 22907 All people should feel safe, valued and equal in society and their workplace and it is imperative to ensure robust complaint structures are in place.
22908 22908 It was our hope, as individuals, that through coming forward at this time, we could achieve justice and enact change.
22909 22909 It is just common sense that the individuals running for the highest office in our land should be required to address any ethical issues before they take the oath of office,.
22915 22915 Today, those of us on the Environment and Public Works Committee are considering the new North American Free Trade Agreement treaty. If we view the treaty solely as a vehicle to address climate change, then we did n't get nearly enough in the agreement -- far from it.
22921 22921 I think he just did n't understand it,.
22923 22923 This is a piece about wish fulfillment and wondering, ` What if there was this band of secret Nazi hunters who were eliminating these people ?.
22926 22926 that enriched bankers and destroyed workers by giving bankers free reign to borrow and speculate without oversight or accountability,.
22927 22927 I predict -- and this is not only the ultimate use case but the ultimate irony -- that once people realize that they can not get gold, they 'll start flocking en masse into Bitcoin.
22928 22928 The good news ... is that Bitcoin at $ 10,000 or $ 9,300 is equally as attractive as it was when it was $ 100,.
22934 22934 The temporary softening of the real estate market will likely be followed by a strong rebound, once the quarantine is lifted,.
22941 22941 If it 's behavioral, it does n't usually end just instantly,.
22946 22946 would provide a little bit of support to consumer spending and to the US economy and to financial markets,.
22952 22952 I would like to see both business and government use the opportunity to make investments. Australian governments and business can borrow at the lowest rates of since Australia became a federation.
22953 22953 The result has been major disruptions to economic activity across the world. This is likely to remain the case for some time yet as efforts continue to contain the virus.
22955 22955 It could be the case that Johnson is posturing now to put this on the table so that he has something to give up for something in return. As a trade negotiator, there 's a logic to that.
22956 22956 something economically meaningful on the fiscal side, from where the real defence must come.
22958 22958 The current closure is taking place during the quarter in which we typically see strong attendance and occupancy levels due to the timing of the Chinese New Year holiday. The precise magnitude of the financial impact is highly dependent on the duration of the closures and how quickly we can resume normal operations.
22960 22960 Today 's oil crisis is a systematic shock that threatens global economic and financial stability. It requires a global answer. That is why the G20 can be an indispensable forum for decisive leadership when it is urgently required,.
22961 22961 In some of these countries, it will be almost impossible to finance essential areas like health or education. It could challenge the stability of these countries where oil is the nerve-centre.
22963 22963 The pressures on companies are changing. They need to show that they can deliver not just the energy that economies rely on, but also the emissions reductions that the world needs to help tackle our climate challenge,.
22970 22970 Governments can use the current situation to step up their climate ambitions and launch sustainable stimulus packages focused on clean energy technologies. The coronavirus crisis is already doing significant damage around the world,.
22975 22975 I think it 's to a certain extent unfortunate that we 're not televised, because I think most would be pleased with what they saw,.
22977 22977 They 're a Chinese company, if people are concerned about data I think there 's a lot to be concerned about there,.
22979 22979 I wrote in @ leaninorg that in an equal world, women would run half our countries and companies and men would run half our homes,.
22981 22981 Paula held up the frayed gray sweater Dave wore most often and I broke down completely. I turned to her and said, ` I ca n't believe you are going through this again. How are you okay ? How can you possibly be okay ?.
22985 22985 I am delighted that the work of arguably the single most influential British artist of all time will now appear on another two billion works of art -- the new £ 20 notes that people can start using today.
22986 22986 In general, the experience has been with pandemics that they can have quite significant impacts but much of it is recovered in subsequent quarters.
22988 22988 These issues have moved very swiftly from being corporate social responsibility issues, or more niche issues within finance, to fundamental value drivers,.
22992 22992 We were trying lots of different ways of reaching people, lots of different messages you could give people, but to try to test what would be most effective,.
22995 22995 have him arrested, detained and hurriedly arraigned before the court on nonexistent and or frivolous charges in order to embarrass and humiliate him thereby lowering his standing in society.
22996 22996 History is full of fake titles, and sometimes you may be able to do things even without one. It certainly means that there is a clear problem within the government : people do n't trust one another, the coalition is dived.
22998 22998 I can not wrap my head around how out of touch this sort of bureaucratic presentation is,.
23000 23000 That would essentially mean they have given in to Russia and lost face.
23002 23002 Clenching your teeth at night while you sleep can result in some serious consequences. This includes sleeping disorders, chronic jaw pain, broken or loose teeth, and severe headaches,.
23004 23004 I could go, like, on Facebook and let everybody know his phone number,.
23005 23005 When I first spoke to this guy, he said, ` I can do this, I can do this, I have these bots,.
23006 23006 We have reassessed the prospect for growth for 2020 and 2021. It is now clear that we have entered a recession -- as bad as or worse than in 2009,.
23012 23012 We are looking at doing what we can to be helpful to Argentina,.
23013 23013 In the end, our answers to this crisis will not come from one method, one region, or one country in isolation. Only through sharing, coordination, and cooperation will we be able to stabilise the global economy and return it to full health.
23015 23015 In terms of scenarios, the more most likely scenario we now view is a V shaped impact. In other words, sharp decline in economic activities in China, followed by a rapid recovery and a total impact on China relatively contained. Therefore, impact on the world economy also contained,.
23018 23018 I would like to extend a warm welcome to him as he joins the Fund team and I look forward to our working closely together. The IMF is putting all hands on deck to help our membership address this crisis -- and Geoffrey will play a key role in our efforts,.
23019 23019 As a result, the impact on the world economy would be relatively minor and short-lived,.
23028 23028 A mandate would fall disproportionately on businesses in the leisure and hospitality industry that have thin margins and are being slammed by the current crisis,.
23029 23029 This should be a commonsense, bipartisan idea ... I hope it becomes law by the end of the week.
23033 23033 If ( federal ) debt stabilizes at 100 percent of GDP, there is almost no conviction anymore that 's a problem.
23034 23034 Unfortunately, the problem may be larger and faster.
23041 23041 Do n't get scared of Brexit. You can exit and look the other way and Africa will be there.
23045 23045 A re-engineered food system would generate new jobs across the whole food system, from agricultural food production through to food processing and retail,.
23049 23049 Avoid the tradition handshake greetings as way of preventing the pandemic, instead go for knee high or elbow to elbow greetings,.
23053 23053 It 's possible, if it 's triggered ... that money would flow in, let 's say in the second quarter of this year and could be used and would be additional to the $ 12 billion dollars that I was announcing today,.
23056 23056 The first goal of the World Bank Group is to provide prompt support during the crisis, based on a country 's needs. It 's also vital to shorten the time to recovery and create confidence that the recovery can be strong,.
23063 23063 We trust the schools, we trust the parents and their capacity to assess if they can strictly implement the DOH requirements,.
23066 23066 How can you sweep the issue of the escape of Ehsanullah Ehsan under the carpet ?.
23067 23067 if everyone worked like the Chinese, it would end very quickly,.
23068 23068 That is the project that needs to happen to move our inter-city buses and create a new transit hub at Allandale, and then we can go ahead with converting the terminal building into a market.
23074 23074 We need to start focusing on a war footing on harvest, the mandis, MSPs ( minimum support prices ) ... start preparation for dealing with more cases of hospitalisations, improve capacity to deal with this should things get worse,.
23075 23075 We are going to experience a sharp collapse in output for one month. We have to spend 2 per cent on medical side which is slightly underestimated ... For one month output loss even if we make up one third of output loss by social cushioning or propping up financial system, still it would be 3 per cent of GDP. So the number we came up with is Rs 10 lakh crore ( Centre and states combined ) or 5 per cent of the GDP,.
23082 23082 You could even argue that it is a blessing in disguise if it has the effect of slowing the spread in the United States,.
23085 23085 It is critical that we give drivers as well as operators of commercial vehicles peace of mind in relation to the status of their licence, learner permit, NCT certificate or certificate of roadworthiness, especially if it has expired or is likely to expire during the period of the Covid-19 health crisis.
23086 23086 And, finally, if we do get substantial progress we will hopefully have another meeting with all of the stakeholders together.
23087 23087 We have to do everything we can to ensure [ coronavirus ] does n't come here and spread to here.
23091 23091 It 's not like you 'll hold two conferences in the fall if the one this spring is canceled.
23099 23099 there could be members of terrorist groups.
23102 23102 The issue that we are looking into is not whether we can launch new combat operations. The issue is whether we can do something that prevents us from being forced into new combat. Prevention is better than intervention.
23104 23104 I think it 's obvious one of the lessons we all have to learn is ... about the importance of resilience and we have to look into issues like the supplies of medical equipment, protective suits, medicines and all that kind of stuff. And also ask questions on whether we are too dependent on production coming from outside, whether we should be producing some of this equipment in our own countries ....
23114 23114 But if destiny chooses a different path for me, I would work in innovations, with new technologies, in the same field as I have always worked : transformation, related to the digital economy,.
23120 23120 We [ Russians ] have a big enough safety margin to finance our obligations .... The current prices in the oil market suggest our reserves could be enough for six years,.
23124 23124 If all the companies go bust, the banks go bust.
23125 23125 If the government had sent a representative, be it the finance minister or second finance minister, would it have been more effective in getting back the money ?.
23126 23126 It does n't give you a lot of confidence that this was carefully thought out,.
23128 23128 One might guess it will go down, but not go away, in summer months,.
23129 23129 Surveillance and containment can only work so well,.
23131 23131 Unless the transmissibility changes, surveillance and containment can only work so well,.
23134 23134 How effective do you think it will be in terms of helping adults to upskill or retrain -- are we ready to go ?.
23135 23135 I think, alas, devolution does not help. It simply adds another layer of bureaucracy and arguing about who gets what.
23136 23136 The trouble with having something that is specialised and specific and that goes through employers is that it is going to be another pot. It is going to have its own regulations. It will work fine if you have a large employer with a trade union that can see what is coming along the road. However, I can not see how it can actually enable the population as a whole to access the flexible opportunities it needs.
23137 23137 In addition to launching T $ 200 billion in financing, I have personally written to and called up the banks one by one, hoping that they can help,.
23139 23139 We welcome the decisions by many businesses who are already offering refunds to all ticketholders, and expect other event and travel businesses to also offer remedies to all affected consumers when events or travel services are cancelled.
23140 23140 We 're doing all we can to encourage companies to work together to get through this, and therefore putting in place quick authorisations, helping them draft them, just doing what we can to keep the authority flowing.
23141 23141 We have authorised the measures by the petroleum industry to enable the companies to ensure the security of the fuel supply for Australian businesses and consumers, especially for when economic activity can increase again,.
23143 23143 You were in fact tricked into thinking you 're getting a big discount when you 're not.
23145 23145 We have taken considerable, recent enforcement action in relation to electricity and telecommunications, and it appears this will continue,.
23146 23146 should not be interpreted as a signal that the ACCC will ultimately accept the undertaking and clear the transaction.
23148 23148 it takes months to get the data that would be relevant to a call like that.
23151 23151 While it is unfortunate that I was unable to go in person to the Directorate of Enforcement ( ED ), our senior authorised representative did attend in person with the requisite information. Needless to say, if in the future any assistance or support to the investigation is requested from us, we will cooperate fully.
23164 23164 If Muslims become more than 30 percent in a particular country, that country is in danger.
23177 23177 The idea is a very old one : before I can decide how happy I am, I have to look over my shoulder, consciously or subconsciously, and see how other people are doing.
23181 23181 About 10 years ago, there was an enormous financial crisis, the biggest one since the 1930s. And this led to a global recession. In some ways, we still have n't recovered from it. I think stopping financial crises is as much a political problem as it is a technical problem,.
23182 23182 I think the fact that we are becoming more national in our orientation, rather than international, is a worrying trend,.
23183 23183 Even if you as an individual and some company dump the same amount of stuff into the water,.
23185 23185 If this were to result in, say, a one-or two-quarter slowdown in growth, that 's probably not something that changes the big picture,.
23186 23186 I think we have the tools to keep the US economy out of deflation and to support the economy through this challenging period,.
23189 23189 The coronavirus will probably cause a substantial amount of economic damage in Japan,.
23191 23191 A pandemic scenario had been raised as a possibility in previous economic policy discussions, but none of us had a meaningful sense of what it would look like on the ground and what it would mean for the economy. We now encounter a grim reality, where exponential growth of contagion means 100 infected individuals become 10,000 in a matter of a few days. Tragically, many human lives are being lost and the virus continues to spread rapidly across the globe. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to the medical professionals and first responders who are working tirelessly to save lives,.
23196 23196 When even elite universities become literal battlegrounds, accusations that the government is attempting to suppress dissent -- even if by apathy rather than design-gain substantial credibility.
23197 23197 There is much to do. The government should call on people with proven expertise and capabilities, of whom there are so many in India, to help it manage its response. It may even want to reach across the political aisle to draw in members of the opposition who have had experience in previous times of great stress like the global financial crisis,.
23199 23199 I anticipate that growth and inflation could rebound this year, compared with last year,.
23200 23200 I think the U.S. we 're going to have a very terrible second quarter,.
23203 23203 The BISP has so far spent about Rs60 billion and the government will expedite the remaining disbursement and if needed additional budget will also be provided,.
23205 23205 Banks were kept afloat by government and taxpayers during the financial crisis -- I would urge them to play their part in helping small and medium-sized businesses through this crisis.
23208 23208 What should you worry about ?.
23212 23212 If this is the start of a coordinated easing of global monetary conditions, then we should look for cuts by other central banks, perhaps during the course of the day today if equity markets tank again,.
23213 23213 in the nearer term ... we believe the greater risk is that the impact of the coronavirus on earnings may well be underestimated in current stock prices, suggesting that the risks of a correction are high.
23216 23216 Israeli society as a whole, and obviously the ultra-Orthodox community within it, must recognize the economic necessity of integrating the ultra-Orthodox community in the future labor market,.
23217 23217 If things get worse in the financial markets, the Bank of Israel has additional monetary tools that it will not hesitate to employ.
23218 23218 Many contributors emphasised the importance of diversity, telling the committee that diverse teams would lead to more diverse thought, and that, in turn, this would help public authorities to identify any potential adverse impact of an AI system,.
23220 23220 Public money should n't be put into public advocacy anyway,.
23224 23224 The Fed 's intervention could help restart that part of the corporate debt market, which is under significant stress,.
23225 23225 You certainly want to take into account what 's happening in financial markets and you certainly want to assess what financial conditions going forward are going to be but I do n't think it 's right to take one day and extrapolate that out.
23226 23226 But, at this point, we can take our time there, because things do seem to be settled down in those markets.
23227 23227 Members noted that they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information related to public health as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and that the Committee would use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy,.
23228 23228 However, going from here to low $ 3,000 s ( as indicated in the assessment above ) is not the most likely outcome, and we believe there is strong support at $ 5,000 in the short-term.
23230 23230 We had three governors, we had a counsel from China, our crew who flew probably more hours than they should have but they knew how important it was.
23234 23234 It 's not only a demand shock, it 's a confidence shock and supply chain disruption shock that central banks could not deal with alone,.
23236 23236 Given that many couples live together before getting married, or choose to live common-law without getting married, it 's possible that your partner gets nothing.
23240 23240 Investors should keep some cash to support their families for at least one year. This is very crazy market and prices can go anywhere. If you survive today, you can come tomorrow to make money,.
23252 23252 What 's more likely is sustained proxy attacks against US interests/allies regionally and even globally.
23253 23253 alarmist numbers based on questionable assumptions should not be used to prolong the lockdown, at least not in its present form. Even if there are 25,000 deaths, the economic costs of the present lockdown are disproportionately high.
23256 23256 The measures taken in this situation should be regarded as a form of insurance that enables Swedish companies, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, to feel secure that the credit supply will not fail,.
23258 23258 It is even more important in this one, where some of the normal social supports are n't there. I think there is an attempt, certainly at UVA, to respond to some of the mental health issues that some of our students and employees may have.
23262 23262 I have learned a lot from this apex body of public relations professionals. I still get to learn about the crucial dynamics of deeper connectivity with people across all strata, and the importance of the story of every individual that you come into contact with. It is important to reinvent oneself continually, and you should ensure that every assignment challenges your limits.
23264 23264 We 'll probably look at a major business change ... where, for the business to survive, we 'll probably swing more bees over to the pollination side of things.
23265 23265 We 've been operating under a philosophy that we had a good young roster and it needed maybe free agents and draft choices and we 'd be very competitive. To keep operating under that philosophy would be like the definition of insanity : doing the same thing and really expecting a different result.
23270 23270 A broad interpretation of our monetary policy mandate would ultimately jeopardise independence, and quite rightly in my view,.
23271 23271 I would like to reassure the Sudanese people that I 'm well and fine,.
23272 23272 If it turns out that the coronavirus becomes more persistent ... we can not look through it.
23275 23275 Truly appalled anyone could do this right now,.
23277 23277 With remote working a likely outcome for many of us in the coming weeks, the security and reliability of our electronic communication will be a high priority,.
23278 23278 The global economy seems to have dodged a recession,.
23279 23279 This would just be a devastating blow to having folks come out to vote when they have to worry about what they have to eat and when their next paycheck will come. It 's just a mess.
23283 23283 the price may get weaker and it would be a good example of a company that is truly becoming very global,.
23284 23284 The process of restructuring must proceed with determination ... initiatives to expand the scale of operations of small banks such as mergers or greater integration of business areas ... can prove beneficial,.
23286 23286 how do you do all this without imposing austerity ? I do n't think people are going to wear the idea that at the end of this period of national suffering, where they have lost their loved ones, their jobs and their freedom, that the light at end of this tunnel is austerity.
23287 23287 It 's been a good 10 years, and his three years probably better than expected,.
23288 23288 The Chinese government has announced that people should consume and have on hand as many onions as they can,.
23289 23289 We have demanded 350 buses in Lahore on an urgent basis otherwise, our demand is of 1,500 buses which can meet the need of the city,.
23291 23291 As IN214436 patent which is the underlying patent for BG-II version of Bt Cotton hybrid seeds has expired, the trait value for BG-II version of Bt Cotton hybrid seeds should also be considered as zero, like in the case of BG-I version, while fixing the sale price for BG-II version.
23297 23297 are well known for being extremely sensitive, and are likely to change dramatically as new information comes in.
23299 23299 eliminate any incentive for reducing use or increasing production.
23300 23300 I am trying to look at all the markets in my district to understand better what that trajectory is going to look like and whether the peaks are going to come sooner so that we can get to the end of this sooner. If that gets extended in some parts we may have to wait longer.
23303 23303 should not let itself be driven by moods and popular feelings.
23304 23304 So, I do n't think there is any chance for the economy to recover very much until the virus itself is under full control ... and that is now at least three to six months away,.
23310 23310 If due process is followed, there is nothing to be worried as any loans can become classified. So, you can not stop issuing loans for this reason,.
23311 23311 If we can foster that same platform and connection for young girls, that 'll give fans more of an opportunity to follow their journey as they go to college and play professional sports.
23312 23312 It 's high time I think for fiscal policy to take charge,.
23314 23314 should maintain the stability of the exchange rate.
23319 23319 But we 're hoping to combine elements of the service together with an opportunity where we can actually see each other and hear each other, ask questions and answer questions, and to really, in that way, connect and feel part of the community.
23322 23322 Nigeria could easily become economically more successful by exporting food to almost every country in Africa -- but not generic food because it is difficult to make money selling generic products. A country 's position is not based on a marketing programme but on global brands that reflect some overall idea.
23324 23324 The fosters are getting to know these animals a lot better than we ever could in a shelter environment so they 're actually able to tell the potential adopters a lot more aobut the pets than we can.
23327 23327 Over the last few days social distancing measures have shut down normal life in much of the US. News reports point to a sudden surge in layoffs and a collapse in spending, both of which appear to be historic in size and speed. We are therefore making further large downward revisions to our economic forecast,.
23333 23333 A key question is whether Modi is willing to use some of his political capital to push through the privatization and related reforms.
23337 23337 This leads to a massive data mining exercise where many things are tried until something works in the sample, you spin a story around it, and it gets published. Many years later it might be found not to hold up out of sample, but you 're already done because you already have tenure. Academically the incentive is to publish at whatever cost. It 's not like you 're falsifying or fabricating ... but it is basically a data mined result.
23338 23338 You get a three-hour high from your happy talk, but lose the long-term ability to be seen as serious, factual and potentially reassuring at a later point when it might be justified. This White House may already be in danger of losing the capacity to be seen as serious.
23342 23342 Larger concern would be a downside for inflation, demand could fall short in the recovery phase and hold inflation lower for a longer period.
23343 23343 I do n't really think the cost of financing is the issue, it 's the availability, given that markets are demanding liquidity,.
23344 23344 You can tell we are there ( near home for the economy ) but still with interest rates really low and still with fiscal policy making a significant contribution. So it 's not being done by the private sector economy. So there is still work to be done.
23347 23347 Our best and only response to it should be to take concerted action.
23350 23350 I first made this prediction when it was $ 1, I said this could go to $ 100,000,.
23354 23354 The five student plaintiffs, who are representing themselves, wrote in a draft of their complaint that the University has benefitted from those alleged investments when it should be trying to help break down a ` system of human caging'.
23358 23358 we remain very concerned about the negative outlook for global growth in 2020 and in particular about the strain a downturn would have on emerging markets and low-income countries.
23361 23361 Can we do it ? Yes. Are we going to do it ? I actually think that we will.
23362 23362 It is clear that we have entered a recession, as bad or worse than 2009,.
23363 23363 While the impact of the epidemic continues to unfold, the WHO 's assessment is that with strong and coordinated measures, the spread of the virus in China and globally can yet be contained and the human tragedy arrested,.
23365 23365 Working together, we can take the necessary steps to reduce uncertainty and put the global economy on more solid footing,.
23366 23366 adoption of legislation to improve the bank resolution framework and on land reform would allow moving forward quickly with finalising the parameters of the new arrangement, with larger access than previously envisaged.
23373 23373 The Covid-19 virus -- a global health emergency -- has disrupted economic activity in China and could put the recovery at risk,.
23374 23374 The outlook for global growth : for 2020 it is negative - a recession at least as bad as during the global financial crisis or worse. But we expect a recovery in 2021,.
23376 23376 entered a recession as bad or worse.
23378 23378 expose financial vulnerabilities that have accumulated during years of low interest rates, leading to a heightened risk that debt can not be rolled over.
23379 23379 New trade tensions could emerge between the United States and the European Union, and U.S.-China trade tensions could return,.
23381 23381 It is very likely that this year the global economy will experience its worst recession since the Great Depression, surpassing that seen during the global financial crisis a decade ago,.
23383 23383 People are not going to work. No significant economic activity is happening. Supply chain is disrupted. If countries turn to protectionism, it would do great damage to the global supply chain,.
23384 23384 There is no trade-off between saving lives and saving livelihoods. Countries should continue to spend generously on their health systems, perform widespread testing, and refrain from trade restrictions on medical supplies. A global effort must ensure that when therapies and vaccines are developed both rich and poor nations alike have immediate access,.
23386 23386 I think in the short term, we do n't need to worry about how to pay for it, we need to be spending money as fast as we can offset the hole in the economy,.
23390 23390 The US could have followed the lead of several major European countries and offered job retention programs, paying most of people 's salaries, but preferred instead to increase and extend unemployment benefits.
23391 23391 It did n't have to be this way ; the US could have followed the lead of several major European countries and offered job retention programs,.
23394 23394 The initial improvement [ in outlook ] was mostly policy-driven, but the greater optimism of the past week seems to be at least partly related to the virus itself,.
23398 23398 Lastly, I was struck by the dignity of his tone throughout this speech. At no point does he display rancour or a sense of injury. He does n't even defend himself -- except on the absurd claim about soldiers not having clothes and shoes.
23400 23400 However, the situation may become unsustainable in the coming weeks, making it extremely important for the government to announce an effective and sizeable package for the economy,.
23403 23403 They wanted to show the world that they could do this, that they would be one of the very few cities to host an Olympics for a second time and that it would be a massive success,.
23404 23404 Yes, it 's about the money that has already been spent on facilities and new infrastructure and the windfall from tens of thousands of foreign tourists, but I think it 's much more about the national political pride of ` Team Abe',.
23407 23407 It is the right policy, since the policy can easily be reversed should a vaccine be discovered or the virus goes away.
23408 23408 We can brag we have the most expensive health care. We can also now brag that it delivers the worst health of any rich country,.
23411 23411 identifying workers who were dispensable altogether, or whose positions in food service, security, janitorial, or transport activities could be outsourced.
23412 23412 We just say do we extradite or not ?.
23415 23415 Anyone who assumes we 're going to get a sharp snapback in activity is n't thinking about how consumers are going to feel. They 're going to be very cautious,.
23416 23416 If the unprecedented confinement measures in China stay in place until the end of February, the resulting economic impact will be concentrated in the first half of 2020, with a reduction in global real GDP of 0.8 % in the first quarter and 0.5 % in the second quarter.
23419 23419 They 're all different, but typically it has been market driven, so a monetary response has often been more effective, whereas this time it 's not clear that it will be. This is partly because interest-rate cuts may not be very effective in an environment of fear where consumers are forced, or just inclined, to stay at home,.
23425 23425 When we look back on 2020 we may well see that it was the worst year ... April may well have been the worst month -- it may go down as Black April,.
23428 23428 But ... this would not be the result of governments and companies adopting new policies and strategies. It would most likely be a short-term blip that could well be followed by a rebound in emissions growth as economic activity ramps back up.
23431 23431 steady movement in the direction of greater transparency and independence over time ( and ) little indication these trends are being rethought.
23433 23433 the ultimate question and challenge of telling a story about the Holocaust : how do I do so without borrowing from a real person 's specific life or experience ?.
23435 23435 We 're facing an epidemic of anti-Semitism, racism, xenophobia, the likes of which we have n't seen in decades. And so this show is really a question. It 's what do you do ? And for this show about a group of vigilantes who try and reclaim the power, the question that the show poses is, if you hunt monsters, do you risk becoming a monster yourself ? And I think that 's a very timely idea and question that we should all be asking ourselves in this day and age.
23436 23436 not as explicitly Jewish as ` Hunters,' I think every story will have some Jewishness to it,.
23437 23437 I think for a long time this anti-Semitism was kind of couched -- people held it inside -- but we 're seeing this expression of anti-Semitism and racism and xenophobia in incredibly violent ways. There 's an epidemic of this in our country and I think unfortunately ` Hunters' is timelier than ever before,.
23439 23439 I simply did not want to depict those specific, real acts of trauma. If the larger philosophical question is, ` Can we ever tell stories about the Holocaust that are not documentary ?' I believe we can and should.
23440 23440 Adding hundreds of dollars to the cost of each vehicle would seem to be the opposite of the more ` affordable ´ vehicles the SAFE rule promised,.
23441 23441 As we examine NEPA 's legacy over the last 50 years, we should be looking to the future. And at a time when we need to be clear-eyed about our climate reality and do everything we can to save our planet, this proposal turns a blind eye to the climate crisis and forsakes our promise to future generations,.
23443 23443 Filing taxes can be complicated and time consuming, and many Delaware families might not know about the benefits they are entitled to claim. I encourage every Delawarean in need of assistance to seek out the free help that is available and avoid leaving money on the table this tax season.
23444 23444 Some have claimed that subpoenaing witnesses or documents would unnecessarily prolong this trial. Is n't it true that depositions of the three witnesses in the Clinton trial were completed in only one day each ? And is n't it true that the Chief Justice as presiding officer in this trial has the authority to resolve any claims of privilege or other witness issues without any delay ?.
23446 23446 You should spend as much as you can on health, on testing, on hospital infrastructure. You should spend as much as you can in a targeted way on things like unemployment insurance, nutritional assistance, paid leave, and help for states,.
23450 23450 I do n't think we 'd last the first chorus of fucking Rock N' Roll Star,.
23453 23453 There 's always one bad egg in the family, [ our mother 's ] still got me and she 's got our Paul, so it is what it is. I think he [ Noel ] is having a mid-life crisis,.
23454 23454 I intend to retire as solo artist after album no3 as I have just had a call from my brother begging me to start oasis again in 2022 if you believe in life after love c'mon you know LG x ( sic ).
23470 23470 If President Trump is re-elected, we can expect $ 1 trillion plus budget deficits for the foreseeable future, and much large deficits when the next recession hits.
23473 23473 unless China can ramp up production,.
23479 23479 When women can move more freely, work outside the home and manage assets, they 're more likely to join the workforce and strengthen the economy.
23481 23481 came from human problems, monetary and financial shocks. This is has some of the same feel, some of the feel of panic, some of the feel of volatility that you 're talking about. It 's much closer to a major snowstorm or a natural disaster than a classic 1930s-style depression.
23482 23482 We 'll probably have to restart activity fairly gradually and there may be subsequent periods of slower activity again,.
23483 23483 if we do n't get the public health right, if we do n't solve the problem of the virus, of the infection, so making sure that the risk has declined sufficiently before put people back in the line of fire.
23485 23485 Hi guys I just thought I 'd let you know that I did test positive for corona I am battling it pretty hard never felt so sick in my life ....
23490 23490 Warehousing and logistics are really good and can address all of these issues. The problem that we saw in the news, in papers, is merchandising could n't keep up with the day-to-day demand, but pallets were going in and relieving stores.
23491 23491 The risk is that we do too little, not that we do too much. And unfortunately, it 's more likely that we do too little. If we want the economy to spring back when the pandemic subsides we need bold fiscal policy efforts now.
23498 23498 Asylum seekers come to the jurisdiction with a variety of documentation. Or potentially no documentation.
23500 23500 This can hardly be acceptable,.
23501 23501 As a result of the epidemic, the same number of people may get infected, but over a longer period of time.
23502 23502 Based on assessment, the economic growth will decelerate to 2.3 percent. Under the worst scenario, the economy may slow down to minus 0.4 percent,.
23503 23503 If you are corrupt, you are going to have to deal with me. I am not going to let you work here and I will put you in prison.
23506 23506 the committee thinks a flat path ( for interest rates ) ... is appropriate.
23508 23508 I was hoping to find some classics and came across this treasure. The joy I felt is indescribable. All I can say after reading that gem is that it was worth the wait. His philosophy left a huge impact on me and that book is one among the many that inspired my entrepreneurial journey,.
23510 23510 If the situation does not escalate beyond the current level, I would say this will be a minor hiccup for the economy. But if it becomes a war and the Strait of Hormuz is closed, then we are looking at a major economic problem.
23516 23516 Obviously, above all I would like to thank my friends and family for standing by me over the last two years,.
23517 23517 likely to widen SNP divisions.
23519 23519 And I think that the impact of some of the publicity over the last 18 months may have led some people, quite innocently perhaps, to revise their opinions and said ` oh well something happened to me' and it gets presented in a totally different way, and people get into the sausage machine and they ca n't get out even if they want to.
23521 23521 We stand by our decision to oppose this merger. If the ACCC won 100 per cent of the cases we took it would be a sign we were n't doing our job properly ; by only picking ` safe' cases and not standing up for what we believe in,.
23525 23525 I am one of those irritating ` glass half full' people. I get upset when Hawthorn loses the grand final. But all we can do is call them as we see them.
23531 23531 I think there will be great reluctance, particularly from the chief medical officer at Commonwealth level but through all the chief health officers to have huge public gatherings in advance of a vaccine,.
23535 23535 It might well be that, even in an environment where sport is able to recommence, [ quarantine hubs ] might be the only practical way to have confidence to get through a season without having to stop and start,.
23537 23537 I would like to make a statement here that the government has no desire or policy to keep the money even a day longer that belongs to the exporters and nor do we find any reason to delay the repayments.
23539 23539 If even this very tight labor market ca n't deliver strong wage growth to me, I 've got to try something else,.
23541 23541 The vast majority of the workforce ca n't work right now, and if I did n't look at this data I might get a skewed idea of what share of people can actually work at home,.
23554 23554 The number one thing, outside of obviously things like handwashing and the social distancing, is trying to allow physicians to provide safe care to people who do n't need an office visit, and to encourage them to either speak to their doctor on the phone or see them virtually.
23556 23556 We trust the schools, we trust the parents, and we trust their capacity to assess if they can implement the guidelines which are publicly known,.
23561 23561 I know that this might not feel like a big priority at a time when so many people are understandably worried about their health, security and loved ones, but it really matters,.
23564 23564 are part of political discourse and that taking political ads means people can speak.
23565 23565 The issue is not what people think of me or Mark personally. The issue is how are we doing as a company ?.
23567 23567 big chunk, if not all.
23570 23570 In order to tide over this critical situation, we had made a request for advance release of the Revenue Deficit Grant provided by the 15th Finance Commission, where we urged you to release the full amount of the grant during the months of April, May and June 2020,.
23572 23572 There is not even a mention of the word slowdown in the entire Union Budget. The Centre should first accept the ground situation and then everyone can put their heads together to work out a solution,.
23574 23574 I basically got the job and then just stopped eating, which ended up causing a lot of problems, and I would not suggest that,.
23582 23582 The other approach to fighting wasteful medical spending starts with looking at health care as a system of goods and services : medications and surgical procedures, administrative processes and physical infrastructure. Some of these enhance health and others do n't, while some of it costs more than its benefits warrant. If you can identify wasteful goods and services and deliver effective care at lower prices, you can make the system more efficient for everyone.
23583 23583 The results from our study may therefore not be as worrying as they first seem, if it means more teachers who are struggling with their mental health are now getting help,.
23584 23584 The social side can not be viewed as different from the economy side. In an autocratic system dissent is more easily suppressed but in a democratic environment it can not be suppressed and this means it is important for the political leadership to work hard to create harmony.
23590 23590 efforts to contain the coronavirus are likely to have a substantial negative impact on the U.S. and global economies, and on equity and credit markets,.
23592 23592 in practical terms it meant that the United States would n't mention certain unpleasant subjects concerning Russia so long as Russia played nice in trade relations and nuclear disarmament and various other areas.
23595 23595 The Super Bowl would not be here had it not been for massive private investment by the Dolphins,.
23602 23602 There are some indications that headwinds to global growth may be beginning to abate,.
23606 23606 I am excited to be leading the Crye-Leike team in Cleveland. We have a lot of great agents and there is no place I would rather be !.
23607 23607 I expressed to him that I really hoped he could continue with us. When he called originally, I thought it was to put together a deal that would allow him to stay. But he made it clear to me he had given it a lot of thought.
23608 23608 Since the beginning of the year, we have indeed seen an increased demand for online delivery services and a significant increase in sales. Some groups of goods grew faster than others in late February-early March, especially goods with a long shelf life : groceries, canned goods, and hygiene products,.
23609 23609 It will allow us to deport foreigners if they are diagnosed with this disease and introduce special restrictions, including isolation and quarantine,.
23615 23615 I think our guys relaxed a little bit. Credit to ( Land O' Lakes ), they stepped up ... They definitely bounced back, but our guys fought back and I was proud of the way they responded.
23621 23621 If any information is sought from us, as a responsible corporate citizen, we will of course provide the same,.
23625 23625 If most Americans who wanted a test could get one, and if people who tested positive stayed home and sought medical attention, fear of going out would n't disappear, but it would dissipate,.
23629 23629 Methods like this are well known for being extremely sensitive, and are likely to change dramatically as new information comes in,.
23631 23631 Once the infection rate stabilises, the number of cases is not rising, I think we 'll see Chinese stimulus. That will be good for us and we 'll return to that gradually improving trend we looked like we were on before the virus.
23634 23634 But the SARS outbreak in 2003 may provide a guide.
23639 23639 The initiative could be a tactical gambit, aimed at opening up space for future moves.
23646 23646 If I went to Davos, it would be to stand behind police barriers.
23652 23652 The ongoing rout in equity markets raises an obvious question : what could break the circuit ? Unfortunately, monetary or fiscal policy are less suited to break the circuit in a crisis of the real economy that stems from medical emergency than in a financial crisis,.
23654 23654 This will be good news for economies that produce oil, economies like Nigeria, but the real question for the Nigerian economy is : can it move away from this basic oil dependency ?.
23656 23656 women are a valuable resource, whose true value is not understood or reflected in market prices,.
23657 23657 Despite our performance, that has included us. One 's risk mitigation strategy must reflect that reality.
23664 23664 Now, the government has mandated that the supply side of the economy must be shut down, and if that 's shut down, that feeds back into the demand side of the economy, and the whole thing just collapses,.
23666 23666 Africa may lose half of its Gross Domestic Product with growth, falling from 3.2 per cent to about 2 per cent due to a number of reasons which include the disruption of global supply chains,.
23667 23667 Of course, you have a good, rising ICT sector where the continent can learn a lot from what you are doing.
23671 23671 Accordingly, we are likely at an inflection point where ` fear' - driven purchases will begin to dominate liquidity-driven selling pressure, as it did in November 2008.
23673 23673 Raising the contribution rate as planned would force many workers to accept a lower-than-otherwise standard of living during their working lives so their living standard in retirement could be higher than they ever were used to when working.
23677 23677 How can we be sure the government will follow on our recommendations,.
23679 23679 The Government must look again at planning policies not just about building on flood plains but the impact of new developments on drainage and the flow of rainwater.
23683 23683 We could have forced more mortgage relief. We could have imposed tighter conditions on dividends and executive compensation,.
23684 23684 So if you have a payroll tax holiday, basically what you 're doing is giving a big chunk of payroll both to workers and firms to help get them see through three or four months that are going to be super negative.
23685 23685 I think in the U.S., we 're going to have a very terrible second quarter. At The Lindsey Group, we just ran the numbers carefully over the weekend, and we think the second quarter will be about minus 5 percent.
23686 23686 stress the importance of race and social issues in driving the white working class away from Democrats, and doubt that a renewed focus on equality would bring those voters back.
23690 23690 I see this second scenario as much more likely.
23692 23692 With the current crisis, though, its purpose should be clear. It ensures that we can continue investing through good and bad times.
23694 23694 I 've got three young kids, so your Saturday 's can quite easily be filled with other things,.
23704 23704 [ A ] fall in interest rates can now cause an initial boom in economic activity as more household debt increases consumption.
23708 23708 Back-testing shows that a particular strategy is likely to outperform the index in the future.
23709 23709 global cooperation to synchronize monetary policy must be high on the agenda.
23711 23711 Her kids have not been able to hug her or get near her ... the kids are always asking what 's wrong with her ... the situation has not been easy,.
23713 23713 Many on the political left are so entranced by the beauty of their vision that they can not see the ugly reality they are creating in the real world.
23715 23715 The smart government response would be to say look we are a risk manager, we are acting now to stabilize the economy,.
23716 23716 I am pessimistic about the German outlook because Germany could experience something like the perfect storm,.
23720 23720 Yes, I 'm sure there 's going to be an increase in traffic, but as a human being I 'd like to think we could make a plan and work around it. Give it a go, folks might like it.
23721 23721 You have to put far more of the power and decision-making in the hands of the individual and that you get better skills for the economy not by asking a government department to organise courses for people that they are sent on but by giving them far greater ability to learn skills when they think they want to.
23723 23723 If we fail to act now, front-line staff and communities will be living with the psychological consequences of coronavirus for decades to come.
23724 23724 Not really. The train has got a long, long way to go if you think about it .....
23727 23727 I would guess Maduro keeps hold of the government with the support of the military, while Guaido heads an opposition that remains divided on issues and strategy,.
23728 23728 These are actually things that are going to facilitate better growth. So that 's one aspect. The second aspect is that the gains can actually be quite big.
23731 23731 We need to widen hi-tech up to a wider population. We are trying to work together, to see how we can coordinate with all the parties, a more collaborative effort, which of course the Israel Innovation Authority should be lead. But I do n't think it 's able to do it alone.
23732 23732 As I will be doing the grocery shopping on behalf of my household, I could also prepare some lunch/dinner/snack packs to have on hand before/after your shift so that you do not have to arrive at or leave your hospital shift hungry.
23736 23736 These pressures have always existed but could be more intense now. They want a more political Commission. I think the Commission was always quite political but this time its politics does not suit the member states.
23743 23743 You 've got to get your priorities in place. Twenty billion pounds would radically overhaul infrastructure in Northern Ireland, with motorways, dual carriageways. You could probably subsidise free ferry transport for over a century and provide free public transport and new rail links for that same amount of money.
23746 23746 If the coronavirus causes a worldwide recession ... that 'll be like the Katrina hurricane for George W. Bush,.
23747 23747 It 's reasonable to assume that those effect will manifest in the data in about two or three months,.
23748 23748 Those with no accounts are also likely to be the people that will be needing the most help.
23749 23749 We have a lot of young people entering the labour force. We need to provide jobs for them and even if much of the growth is job-oriented, 5 % simply does n't cut it,.
23752 23752 If this becomes a world issue, with ripples through many countries and many economies, then that 's a different type of event than as I understand it to be today,.
23754 23754 Or at least we go to the old highs.
23757 23757 they might be very good.
23761 23761 Some forms of debt forbearance ... may be needed -- for instance by extinguishing private sector loans vacuumed by the central banks,.
23763 23763 There 's going to be some really special moments that are going to happen as part of Super Bowl Sunday this year -- that if it can top even a Super Bowl -- this is going to be really special,.
23769 23769 What 's more, the Trump administration 's response -- cutting taxes to put more money in people 's pockets -- is exactly the kind of measure we should be avoiding.
23772 23772 Our goal is to keep enterprises operating. If they fail to have enough cash flow, liquidity, their capacity to repay debt will become a problem,.
23773 23773 Adjustment of the thresholds ensures that potentially anti-competitive M & A s are subject to compulsory notification and review, while those that are less likely to pose competition concerns are excluded,.
23774 23774 It is a great way to get around the city, from point A to point B, in locations where the metro is not convenient and where a walk would take 20 minutes.
23775 23775 It 's very much something that is linked to specific schools like our School of Foreign Service or policy schools elsewhere.
23776 23776 Monetary policy, however, can not on its own improve the potential growth rate of the economy or reduce fiscal risks. These should be addressed by implementing prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that lower costs generally, and increase investment opportunities, potential growth and job creation,.
23786 23786 That 's why we are underlining a green BRI would be not only good for the world, it also would be good for China,.
23787 23787 The heightened role of private equity firms in US health care should alarm consumers, policy makers, and really, everyone,.
23791 23791 Can we simply sit and allow the foreign firms have controlling stake in NBFCs and payment firms ? We simply can not. The cost of inaction would be huge national security risk. There is also absence of data protection law in this country and we are finally moving in that direction,.
23792 23792 Someone needs to lead, and Maryland should be that leader.
23793 23793 The Italian borders should be closed as soon as possible. The situation is much worse than 1 million refugees coming to Europe.
23795 23795 We are about to witness a downturn that could dwarf the Great Recession,.
23796 23796 Everybody would then fall under Medicare, to try to take advantage of some of the lower administrative costs in the Medicare system,.
23797 23797 If there were global temperatures more than 2C or 3C above the current average temperature, this would take the climate outside of the range of observations which have been made over the last several hundred thousand years.
23798 23798 It is easy to believe Biden thought minor cuts in the program in the short run would represent a better outcome than the much bigger cuts President Reagan and his advisers seemed to favor,.
23806 23806 Regulations or taxes on emissions,.
23807 23807 The economic downturn will lead to rising deficits but given current low levels of interest rates this can be handled,.
23812 23812 But I think we have to do what people in the rapid response services do : pray for the best, prepare for the worst.
23814 23814 I think the world is changing much faster today than it was 10-20-30 years ago. Insecurity is the new normal thing. So we need to help our members be more agile, more adaptable,.
23818 23818 We do project recovery in 2021 -- in fact, there may be a sizeable rebound, but only if we succeed with containing the virus -- everywhere -- and prevent liquidity problems from becoming a solvency issue.
23823 23823 So then we can agree on synchronised, or even better, coordinated measures to protect the world economy from a more serious shock,.
23828 23828 If we give in to blind self-confidence, the epidemic could rebound and the virus exploit us when we are off guard,.
23830 23830 In our current baseline scenario, announced policies are implemented and China 's economy would return to normal in the second quarter. As a result, the impact on the world economy would be relatively minor and short-lived,.
23832 23832 reduced by 0.3 % what would have been the cost on the world economy.
23841 23841 All judges are given to me in advance to look at -- maybe two or three days -- which means that we are, basically, proofing them from political favouritism,.
23842 23842 As soon as deposits, especially the government agencies' funds, are available, the banks would be able to implement the lending rate,.
23843 23843 But now the situation could change and we will finance all the expenses we have undertaken and are obliged to make with this treasure chest.
23845 23845 If everybody stays home for six months, then, you know, it 's hard to -- it 's going to be like the Great Depression,.
23847 23847 If everybody just stays home for six months, then it 's going to be like the Great Depression,.
23848 23848 If there is going to be full contact training, then I think prudence would dictate that should n't occur without clearance from the chief health officer.
23850 23850 Iran right now is reeling from the assassination, but the leadership is dominated by hardliners and the question is how, not whether, they will respond,.
23852 23852 Further big drops are likely in April, because lockdowns began to bite hard only in mid-March, so roughly half the month was largely unaffected by the virus crisis,.
23860 23860 appear to have over-estimated the real impact of the trade war.
23867 23867 These are the complementary economic measures, that in the short run, when people can neither work nor consume as freely as they would have, are absolutely essential to minimise the economic pain and prevent short-term economic shocks.
23868 23868 Undeniably, what we are facing today is a very serious situation but it 's also something that 's temporary. As we deal with it as best we can, we also need to look to the other side when things do recover,.
23870 23870 perhaps we are getting to that crossover point.
23871 23871 China is a larger part of the global and it is more closely integrated, including with Australia, so the international spillovers could be larger than they were back in 2003.
23875 23875 At the moment, I think it 's affecting confidence of people and therefore ultimately spending.
23880 23880 send a message that Virgin was in trouble and would not survive.
23881 23881 It 's a serious proposal but we still have an open mind on whether it addresses the problem. So we 're seeking comment, and we 'll take that comment into account as we continue to make our decision as to whether to approve or not approve the merger,.
23882 23882 It 's got to be clearly false as opposed to something someone believes is false and that is a tricky line. I do n't think you can take it to the bushfires at this stage, it is too contested.
23886 23886 Although the very recent changes to NBN Co 's products and pricing are helpful, the ACCC is continuing to consider whether further action is needed to make sure consumers are n't worse off when they switch to the NBN.
23887 23887 Without the sale of five beer and cider brands including Strongbow and Stella Artois, the combined Asahi-CUB company would have accounted for two thirds of cider sales in Australia, and owned the two largest cider brands, Somersby and Strongbow,.
23889 23889 We might have some goals for the future. We might have some things we want to do now. But the world is trying to derail us,.
23892 23892 What Iran has requested for is RFI, Rapid Financial Instrument, which is an automatic instrument that governments and countries can use when they are in need of some financing,.
23895 23895 Despite near-term disruptions, slowing down the rise of Covid-19 cases would be worth a lot. Ultimately the course which the disease takes will matter more for the global economy and markets than any monetary and fiscal action.
23896 23896 The recovery could begin in June as the spread of the virus slows down and a surge in government spending enables health systems to cope better than before but even with a rebound in H2 2020 [ the second half of 2020 ], annual GDP for the year as a whole would decline by 1 % in the Eurozone and 0.7 % in the UK. Previously, we had expected -0.1 % yoy [ year-on-year ] for the Eurozone and 0.9 % yoy for the UK as our base case. From such a low level, GDP could rebound by 2.0 % in the Eurozone and by 2.3 % in the UK in 2021,.
23898 23898 So, the catastrophe of climate change is already on us. We are not waiting for, you know, the next century or for our children. We are the children we are talking about who are suffering from climate change. And unfortunately, the talks that we are seeing in Doha are not reflecting the urgency that is required by what is happening out in the world.
23903 23903 People should not be trivializing this disease -- while it is for most a mild to moderate illness, for some it 's not.
23906 23906 I would recommend that if you want to rebut the evidence in the manuscript, then you should look at the evidence presented in the manuscript.
23907 23907 If you extrapolate past trends and taking account of the likelihood of some weakening in the Australian economy, it is quite likely that underemployment will continue to rise.
23910 23910 There is nothing to celebrate in a likely decline in emissions driven by economic crisis because in the absence of the right policies and structural measures, this decline will not be sustainable,.
23913 23913 We certainly see the lowest oil demand growth in the last 10 years and we may need to revise it ... downwards,.
23914 23914 Without measures by governments, cheaper energy always leads consumers to use it less efficiently. It reduces the appeal of buying more efficient cars or retrofitting homes and offices to save energy.
23916 23916 We have started discussions with the Minister for Employment and Labour Relations, we are institutionalizing this meeting in such a way that the framework for developing the quarterly labour market survey would be jointly owned by the Ministry of Employment and Labour Relations and the Ghana Statistical Service.
23919 23919 Because if he thinks I 'm joining the High Flying Birds but calling it Oasis, he 's got another thing coming.
23920 23920 After album no3 I 'm gon na split up with myself I just do n't think I 'll be able to work with myself any longer I can write what I like and so can he but I think it 's for the best.
23922 23922 I wrote a song last year called The worlds in need - / : ; ( £ ) ( might have to release it does n't matter if it 's out of tune as it 's true c'mon you know LG x ( sic ).
23926 23926 as an elected representative to take a pro forma or in name only stance.
23929 23929 By approving this resolution, the city council will go on the record opposing religious persecution and Islamophobia, the discrimination, scapegoating and oppression of Muslims, poor people and marginalized communities by the Hindu fundamentalist regime of the Bharatiya Janata Party, or the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
23936 23936 If we had a timely unemployment statistic, the unemployment rate probably would be up to 12 or 13 % at this point and moving higher,.
23938 23938 The Fed is doing everything they can to keep financial markets functioning and credit available to households and firms,.
23940 23940 In that scenario, the recession may be deep, but at least it will have been short. But that is n't the only possible scenario : if critical economic relationships are disrupted by months of low activity, the economy may take a very long time to recover.
23941 23941 If you target individuals ... let 's start out by saying, most of the people in Russia are victims of the same individuals that killed Sergei Magnitsky or did other things like that. Therefore, if you were to sanction the country, the people would be victimised twice. First by the dictators and then by the sanctions. However, if you sanction the individuals then you 're going straight to the problem as opposed to creating unexpected consequences among the victims.
23943 23943 If I could do it all over again, I would never have gone to Russia in the first place. I would gladly trade all my business for Sergei 's life. I now understand how completely naive I was to think that as a foreigner I was somehow immune to the barbarity of the Russian system.
23946 23946 It has been 72 hours but Delhi Police has not arrested anyone. This is being done intentionally. We demanded that those responsible for the incident should be arrested,.
23948 23948 In that period, Krishna Menon played an important role in convincing Nehru that Partition was inevitable ... V P Menon sold the idea of Partition to Patel. Both Menons had come round to the view that the Muslim League and the Congress could not work together,.
23951 23951 It is not clear to me that GW 's academic reputation or status has benefited from this substantial increase in debt,.
23957 23957 If we do n't do that we will have a big problem, for certain, and then we may end up 2-3 years down the road back in a big combat operation,.
23963 23963 The global economy was already very weak because of the trade war, and it would not take much to shove it on its heels,.
23965 23965 If Chinese workers and students are n't able to travel to their jobs and universities for over two months, this will cause significant adjustments and economic costs.
23966 23966 That supports consumer confidence. That helps in terms of cash -- stockholders can realize those gains, it makes it easier for them to borrow,.
23967 23967 It may be what economists call a black swan -- a rare and inherently unforeseeable event with severe consequences.
23968 23968 A global recession is likely if COVID-19 becomes a pandemic, and the odds of that are uncomfortably high.
23969 23969 If Congress gets this together quickly, it would help to soothe frayed nerves from the falling markets,.
23970 23970 The only thing, obviously : If the virus becomes a pandemic and significantly destroys the global economy and the U.S. economy, it does n't matter how low rates can go.
23975 23975 And so that made me think, ` Well, we need to go back and redo it,'.
23977 23977 Without healthy diets, we can not hope to end malnutrition -- and we will not eradicate hunger unless we curb food losses. The UN has taken a decisive step to promote fairer, greener, more efficient food systems,.
23978 23978 But I think a firefighter has never been criticized for using too much water.
23980 23980 Quite a lot has happened during the past three months. Global economic growth appears to have bottomed, as shown by an upturn in trade and manufacturing indicators,.
23982 23982 The labour market, that 's easy right ? We can ask firms, how many people are working for you ? How much are they making ? Those are real. The survey part, the household part, of course it 's a survey, but even so, it has stood the test of time.
23984 23984 can be very unhealthy.
23987 23987 whether the new decade is starting with a bang.
23990 23990 It 's reasonably plausible that the demand impact would be greater than the supply impact in the near term because of confidence effects,.
23991 23991 While CBDC ( central bank digital currency ) poses a number of opportunities, it could raise significant challenges for maintaining monetary and financial stability ... and would need to be very carefully designed if it were to be introduced,.
23992 23992 Activity is likely to weaken materially in the coming months. The reduction in bank rate will help bolster confidence at this difficult time.
23995 23995 that if you add up the policies of all of the companies out there, they are consistent with warming of 3.7-3.8 C.
23997 23997 too early to tell what it means for the UK, or its magnitude ... the system is functioning. We 're very confident about that, and we 're on top of it.
24000 24000 I think I wanted it to feel like a microcosm of what the show is. It begins as this kind of utopic, ` 70s Brady Bunch sitcom and then very slowly, you feel a little off kilter and a little unnerved. And then the poppy sort of utopia begins to descend into this scintillating unease and then into this direct, overt horror.
24004 24004 People should already now be feeling real changes for the better,.
24006 24006 We find that the US is saying that India is not falling in line with its line on the trade deal s. There may be defence deals and the purchase of equipment is decided by the government on the basis of requirements. On trade deal part, from RCEP days to date, Indian govt is taking a tough stand,.
24012 24012 In the long run, unless we have an economic model, a social model, and an ecological model that appeals to the rest of the world, China may be the winner of this great rivalry,.
24014 24014 To say that we 're going to close them all, or even a significant number of them, is I think foolish if we 're serious about addressing climate change and the climate crisis,.
24018 24018 This is the quickest way we can jumpstart government-wide climate action,.
24019 24019 In my view, the priority should be right now to stop a collapse in output capacity, both in the United States and Europe. I think it 's critical to keep companies that are basically good and solvent alive ... so when the pandemic is finally wound down, we can revive production quickly,.
24022 24022 My primary responsibility is to you, to make sure you are safe, to make sure your families are safe, to make sure you can function where you are under the best possible conditions health and security-wise,.
24025 24025 The youth must be prepared for the jobs of the future-not the jobs of the past,.
24028 24028 in the courts if he wants.
24029 24029 any black money or corruption where babus and netas start using crypto instead of currency notes,.
24030 24030 I can tell you that 's the misinterpretation of Article 14. Article 14 guarantees equality of equals.
24042 24042 We have to be realistic that there 's a limit on what monetary policy can achieve in this environment,.
24043 24043 are drinking themselves to death, or poisoning themselves with drugs, or shooting or hanging themselves.
24045 24045 Either they feel cornered by the Fed to act, or they sit this one out to leave room for fiscal measures and show they can remain above the fray.
24052 24052 You can see a lot of people right next to the dumpsters. Go to the farmers market in the evening. The poor will collect the wasted [ produce ] while the sellers are tidying up their stalls,.
24054 24054 They are looking around, but they can not find a way out,.
24055 24055 The government may not support our proposals or can find them not sufficient. But we know that a quick solution to the Idlib problem can be found if it endorses our proposals,.
24059 24059 If you have job security and emergency reserves intact, you should buy, buy, buy as much as you can and get to the max as soon as you can. You do n't know where the bottom is, but you 're far from the top,.
24062 24062 The attitudinal change and transformation that we seek to achieve will not be achieved over a short time. We need to get the buy-in of all Ghanaians. The agenda is not for the New Patriotic Party or any political party. Successive governments are free to design programmes to achieve specific targets of the agenda,.
24065 24065 There could be some signaling that they will look at the measure of inflation they target and there 's also discussion over whether they should discuss the policy tools available.
24066 24066 The question is do you want to control the movement of people, restrict the circulation of labour which has been the Brexit way, or do you want to better control the movement of capital and how much investors are able to avoid taxation.
24067 24067 doing everything possible to guarantee and improve the lowest pensions ( between one and three times the minimum wage ), even if that means a bigger ask of those on very high salaries and with assets.
24068 24068 There are doubts whether from now on fair and neutral elections can be held in this country in future,.
24075 24075 They are places where individuals are encouraged both to listen and to speak, where the value of an idea is discussed and debated -- not suppressed or silenced.
24078 24078 I think, frankly, it has been proven. It does work, and frankly, I think there 's even too little indexing now. There ought to be even more indexing,.
24082 24082 Until a vaccine is available, nobody is going out to work, play or go to school. The economy, national, regional and global we knew is dead, it 's not coming back,.
24083 24083 You may not like what he did, fine. I do, other people may not, but he did the job,.
24087 24087 Economic indicators will likely show significant improvement in the second quarter and the Chinese economy will return to potential output level rather swiftly,.
24089 24089 In China, with a command economy, they can really put resources behind the cure and the solution. So I do n't think it will be as long as people expect,.
24090 24090 We can expect continuing volatility,.
24091 24091 I do n't think there is a rule of nature that will keep rates at their current level forever,.
24092 24092 The outcome should be that we have an inflation objective that everyone on the Governing Council explains in identical terms,.
24095 24095 I can tell you we understand the sense of urgency and the Fed is working as quickly as possible.
24097 24097 people are responding in ways they respond to other uncertainties. Like in an impending hurricane, they are stocking up on canned goods, toilet paper, etc.
24100 24100 Central banks should be prepared to provide liquidity to banks and financial companies, especially those who lend to more vulnerable small - and medium-sized businesses,.
24102 24102 We need to revive domestic investment in India, consumption spending is weak. So I think the environment has to be created for greater investment because that 's what will raise the capital stock and raise India 's potential growth,.
24104 24104 Global hotel giants are now more exposed to Asia, meaning any downfall in revenue could hurt deeper,.
24105 24105 It 's a responsibility I think central banks do n't want,.
24108 24108 This requires a 40 percent increase this year and another 40 percent increase in 2021. That seems like a stretch goal,.
24109 24109 When a country has a successful labour trade, this brings about evolution of the economy, then it can be referred to as a developed economy. The establishment of these two tools, land and labour, will bring about economic evolution,.
24111 24111 If you wanted to really make a difference in a bunch of families' lives right now, and you absolutely did n't need those dollars, I would really consider passing that along to an organization that does a lot of good for a lot of people,.
24113 24113 The latest CREA data shows that the national average home price surged 9.6 % year-over-year in December. A lower stress test rate would make a busy spring housing market even more active.
24116 24116 It would stabilize the wealth of billionaires,.
24117 24117 This will be a test of will and competence. Thousands, perhaps millions, of lives depend on it,.
24119 24119 Anyone who phones up and says a member of their family is sick with virus symptoms are not given any assurances that they wo n't be penalised if they stay off and self isolate so they are coming in to work. Call centres in general are a hotbed for disease as people share desks.
24120 24120 He obviously thinks the Left was a momentary phase in our history and that we should be apologised for and forgotten.
24124 24124 men are supposed to sweep us off our feet,.
24127 24127 The right question is who has a factory in their supply chain for which there are employees who went home to Wuhan or any of the other cities with significant numbers of infected people for the Lunar New Year ? And what will happen when they start to come back, whenever that turns out to be ?.
24128 24128 From the onset of any project, our customers can strategically plan for the entire life span of their idea,.
24138 24138 We will do well only if others do well alongside us,.
24140 24140 People are n't going to either have the money because they have been out of work, or the appetite.
24147 24147 Media reports suggest that Sanjay Nathalal Shah, Chartered Accountant and an independent director of a few of our group companies, is alleged to be connected to Capstone.
24148 24148 most economists believe that fundamentally that is traceable to technological change that has occurred over the past two or three decades.
24150 24150 The big numbers should be interpreted as, this is how bad it would get if it repeated itself for a whole year.
24152 24152 To me, if you do n't get something right, the biggest thing you need to do is recognize it and fix it,.
24155 24155 We need a much, much larger stimulus -- at least two or three times that amount,.
24164 24164 We are going to experience a sharp collapse in output for one month. We have to spend 2 per cent on medical side which is slightly underestimated ... For one month output loss even if we make up one third of output loss by social cushioning or propping up financial system, still it would be 3 per cent of GDP. So the number we came up with Rs 10 trillion ( Centre and states combined ) or 5 per cent of the GDP,.
24173 24173 I do n't want to get political but there is a lot of chat about how we are going to hell in a handcart in the 2020s but actually, most people are incredibly open-minded, warm and well-intended -- certainly much more than 100 or even 20 years ago. Open your history books. We can get better but this cast made me think we 're gon na be all right.
24174 24174 I think that would be quantitatively a much bigger deal for UCLA financially.
24177 24177 payroll tax is probably the most favorable if you are not using premiums,.
24181 24181 We have two choices : to abandon hope and ensure that the worst will happen, or to make use of the opportunities that exist and contribute to a better world. It is not a very difficult choice.
24187 24187 We should n't let anyone into a supervisory position until we 're sure that they have collaboration skills, that we 've worked on their emotional intelligence, that they 're problem solvers, that they 're willing to take some risks.
24192 24192 It should be kept in mind that Bank BIC Namibia Limited is owned by multiple shareholders and the Bank of Namibia is not aware of any development that could threaten the stability of BIC Namibia at the moment,.
24195 24195 She is the chair. So if you are interested, you bring such an agenda, discuss in a federalist polity as to who will do what. How can she say that states must decide,.
24200 24200 I would n't intend to accept that. The British Government made commitments here, as part of all the rest of us. They ca n't come today and congratulate us for living up to our commitments and then not live up to their own.
24202 24202 It will create significant growth companies we have n't even heard of yet, but it could also reshape a lot of big companies we have heard of, especially the energy majors.
24205 24205 So if this were going to last just that long, $ 1 trillion might be enough,.
24212 24212 This scheme is not just for studies related to health, pharmaceuticals, biology or chemistry. Instead, we want to encourage interdisciplinary studies to solve and deliberate on Covid-19,.
24213 24213 This study helps us understand where laws facilitate or hinder women 's economic participation. It has incentivized countries to undertake reforms that can eliminate gender imbalances,.
24215 24215 A man can certainly be the more flexible member of the household, though he typically is not. Such decisions need to be made couple by couple.
24219 24219 Though really, the best place to sit is away from any passenger who 's coughing or sneezing. There was a perimeter around the person with increased risk,.
24223 24223 He seemed quite perky,.
24227 24227 If you already clench and grind, stress could make the habit worse. It can lead to problems with the Temporomandibular joint that 's located in front of your ear where the skull and lower jaw meet. Try a night guard, worn as you sleep, or another appliance to help you stop or curb your grinding. During the day, try to keep your teeth slightly apart when you 're not eating.
24228 24228 the deeper into the population of firms likely closures will occur, and the greater the feedback into consumer incomes and expectations,.
24230 24230 In a great state like Maryland, that is not something that we should expect as normal or OK.
24233 24233 If the virus spreads, as it has spread in Italy and the United States, we have to take it very seriously. What you see in these countries is a tremendous effect on public health, the overburdening of many hospitals and many deaths and of course, when that is happening economic activity is hard to carry on,.
24246 24246 I think this is just another regeneration of exactly the same problem -- the Chancellor is trying to do things to boost the overall rate of growth but we are concerned it will not happen.
24247 24247 They change, and they influence others who are close to them, and the chain can spread out over a long distance.
24250 24250 Under the current organisational structure, the tax policy units are an integral part of the tax administration. This often results in conflicts of interest and distorted policy initiatives. In the modern view of organising public administration, the role definition of MoF should clearly be about policy formulation. Implementation work should be done through external, autonomous agencies. Appeal mechanisms ( such as tribunals ) should be separate from these implementation agencies, and should be placed under the Ministry of law.
24253 24253 There are all kinds of things that you can identify as relevant, and the question is : Does the public need to know ? I do n't know the answer to that question,.
24254 24254 My suggestion was to have let the Bank of Ghana find a means to pay the affected customers even if it involved the printing of money ... We are making it difficult for the NPP to win this election.
24255 24255 quite frankly, I would think that some people perhaps who under different circumstances would not be let out are being let out.
24262 24262 If you take risk and you do n't have to pay for it, you 'll take more risk until you get slapped in the face.
24266 24266 This is particularly important for low-achievers, where any association is likely to be strongest.
24268 24268 The declared focus of the Morrison government is to ` keep Australians safe and secure'. Surely climate change is our major national security issue, out-ranking the risk of invasion, terrorism and regional insecurity. The role of our defence forces should be broadened to include specific national disaster responsibilities, to be expeditiously mobilised amid fire crises, and then for recovery.
24270 24270 fire his entire debate team, and they should never be in campaigns again,.
24280 24280 While free market diehards may turn up their nose, this is probably a lesser evil,.
24282 24282 conviction eventually be overturned, especially if Pakistan comes off the FATF grey list ?.
24285 24285 there likely would be a greater turnout among lower-income groups and minorities, which could lead to a change in the types of politicians elected.
24286 24286 We had an 11-year recovery, but the labor market did n't get to anywhere what people would call tight until 2018,.
24289 24289 And therefore because this is my country, and I am now a Scottish citizen, I believe in a democracy we should have the right to choose every day of our lives.
24290 24290 As a statistician, we can never underplay the role of chance.
24291 24291 If you stay home to look after a family member and at the end of two weeks you fall sick yourself, your sick leave will have run out, so you will have an incentive to return to work and infect people there,.
24292 24292 In addition to their core work both in custody and post arrest, the Liaison and Diversion Service may also be able to help with a course of action or provide other meaningful advice to officers who are planning to bring particularly challenging members of the public into custody who are already known to other agencies.
24293 24293 It 's really much closer to a major snowstorm or a natural disaster than it is to a classic 1930s-style depression.
24296 24296 This is a time when we must all play our part. This global pandemic must bring citizens, governments and business leaders together -- and quickly,.
24300 24300 With a peer-to-peer botnet, there is no single point that can be removed to take down the botnet entirely,.
24302 24302 It could be problematic, particularly for manufacturers,.
24305 24305 We have not decided on countries. We have been looking at types of countries as the first thing to decide is if there 's a case for expansion.
24306 24306 We think that recognition of these problems would by itself contribute somewhat to improving matters.
24307 24307 A rising population can create a false illusion of prosperity, as it did in so many Sun Belt metros, which built their house of cards economies around housing construction and real estate development .... But America 's economic winners are the places that have improved their productivity.
24313 24313 The LTV rules could have been separately challenged as being ultra vires the act,.
24314 24314 We have done this during the Marawi crisis were displaced learners are accepted in schools nearby the place where their families evacuated. With or without credentials, they should be admitted to those schools,.
24317 24317 But if you actually look at the numbers, the latest numbers coming in the last few years do n't actually show any shift in the diversity of samples.
24318 24318 If we provide constructive opposition, I have no doubt we 'll regain the trust of the Portuguese people,.
24319 24319 It is moving faster but also ; it can be resolved faster.
24321 24321 who was bleeding and appeared to be intoxicated.
24324 24324 If unity is not there still we have to move on and do whatever is necessary,.
24328 24328 If we limit work hours, we 'll be hurting those women, and it 's the same for Arab society,.
24329 24329 The world must be vigilant not to let xenophobia manifest at times like this,.
24330 24330 This year 's finalists demonstrate the progress that can be made when governments listen to small business owners and take the steps to address their concerns. We thank all the finalists for their tremendous leadership and the results they have accomplished and we look forward to announcing the winners next week.
24335 24335 Logan can do that in spades. It 's the quietude about his performances. He has such heart and soul, and it 's simply there, within him.
24336 24336 I think it was very important to us to ensure that the scenes in the past were all approached in a sobering, reverential, respectful way. To not have it feel as heightened --.
24339 24339 It was Judah Maccabee and Jeff Goldblum and there was no one in between ! I just wanted to represent a Jewish superhero who was n't nebbishy or just intellectual or just kind of this punch line, but instead had might and power and strength. And so Hunters was born from that urge.
24342 24342 She appreciated the logic of randomized control trials. At the same time she would not be satisfied with just that to see the outcome of an intervention.
24343 24343 The experience of successful developing economies shows that sustained progress can be achieved only with a governance system based on strong state institutions and in-built mechanisms to ensure efficiency and accountability at all levels of state machinery,.
24344 24344 Since the onshore yuan ( CNY ) stopped trading for the holiday, the dollar appreciated by a net of a little less than 1 % against the offshore yuan ( CNH ). A catch-up move of roughly the same magnitude would bring the greenback toward CNY7.0. While the last time the dollar rose through that threshold, the US accused China of currency manipulation, this time is considerably different. Moreover, of all times, this is the time when China could likely get away with manipulation if it wanted,.
24345 24345 Sterling seems to be caught between the bid from the under-weight asset managers and some speculators seeing the Brexit uncertainty lifted on the one hand, and the under-appreciated risks of a rate cut and a no-deal Brexit still on the other,.
24346 24346 The NGA is a white elephant with one destination picture, Blue Poles, that was a shrewd purchase but perhaps a thing that nobody really loves,.
24348 24348 more ideas than they can digest,.
24349 24349 The teenage climate activist was due to be speaking here but her team have said she is unwell. But she may well be putting the finishing touches to comments for an opening day of the summit when the 17 year old will again have the ear of the world 's most powerful.
24352 24352 It 's really not an issue of billionaires sit on piles of cash, of idle money that the government should take,.
24355 24355 We would be extremely keen to talk to anybody who has any information about this, we have very sophisticated processes for protecting the identity of anyone who does come forward,.
24358 24358 Importantly, the approval does not allow fuel companies to coordinate prices, including retail and wholesale fuel prices, and storage prices, and we will continue to closely monitor retail petrol prices across Australia and call out any excessive pricing or illegal behaviour.
24360 24360 We urge owners to check if their vehicle is affected, by visiting the Product Safety Australia website or contacting their manufacturer,.
24361 24361 With the merger we 've got three big players and I do n't think any of them will want to rock the boat and so that will mean higher prices for consumers than they would have got under the alternative world of TPG entering,.
24367 24367 We all hope for a V-shaped, rapid recovery -- but given the uncertainty, it would be prudent to prepare for more adverse scenarios.
24370 24370 if tomorrow we wake up with 100 percent gender equality, the wealth of this world would be, according to the most recent data, $ 172 trillion bigger. We would be a much richer world.
24383 24383 Stability will remain a challenge in the decade ahead. In the 2020s, the financial sector will have to grapple with preventing the traditional type of crisis, and handle newer ones, including climate related shocks. Think of how stranded assets can trigger unexpected loss. Some estimates suggest the potential costs of devaluing these assets range from $ 4 trillion to $ 20 trillion.
24385 24385 Britain has a world-class, thriving private sector that needs championing and supporting with great policy. But when things go wrong I waste no time in holding those responsible to account, whether fault lies in government or business.
24388 24388 If restrictions are lifted prematurely, the result will be a follow-on pandemic surge. More people will die. What will the policy choice be then ?.
24394 24394 New conflict would be in no one 's interest,.
24398 24398 Because together with Europe and Canada, we represent 50 percent of the world 's military might and 50 % of the world 's economy, so together we are strong.
24400 24400 ministers also agreed to explore what more could be done, beyond this first step.
24404 24404 My office 's review of the draft final rule indicates that it utterly fails to provide any demonstrable safety, environmental, or economic benefit to consumers or the country,.
24405 24405 We should be enacting forward-looking environmental policy, not tying our country 's future to the dirty vehicles of the past,.
24408 24408 Iran 's leaders probably are n't suicidal ; we doubt they will take action that will trigger air strikes on Tehran,.
24409 24409 This is an all-out effort to ensure that the business sector can continue to exist even as economic activity temporarily collapses,.
24411 24411 We 're expecting a slowing in gross hiring to depress the March number, though we see no evidence this hit has been augmented by increased layoffs, yet. April likely will be much worse.
24417 24417 In this case, everyone is cutting their spending and lots of people, even if they do n't lose their jobs, will lose time at work, hours, tips, potentially a large blow to their income,.
24418 24418 The temporary softening of the real estate market will likely be followed by a strong rebound once the economic ` quarantine' is lifted, and it 's critical that supply is sufficient to meet pent-up demand.
24420 24420 [ Chinese ] people who are wealthy may feel tired of the perception of China as being a third-world country,.
24425 24425 While the Cubs would like to reset under the luxury tax threshold for strategic reasons, ownership is well aware of the financial challenges they are currently dealing with in player payroll. Ownership is also prepared to navigate another year in the luxury tax if the club remains in the playoff picture in 2020.
24429 24429 Looking through the monthly vagaries of the data, job gains continue to moderate. Manufacturers, energy producers, and small companies have been shedding jobs. Unemployment is low, but will begin to rise if job growth slows much further.
24432 24432 For JNU there should n't be Delhi police alone but also a camp of BSF and CRPF.
24435 24435 We may have a function in Darjeeling in May. Obviously, it should be made a union territory. I have already said that ` Gorkhaland' as a separate UT is a demand that we have promised to you. We have three Lok Sabha seats out of you.
24436 24436 We have been always of the view that we have a spiritual country and we can not leave out religion and spirituality completely.
24437 24437 For those businesses where people were already able to occasionally work from home, and where there had already been some adoption of the technologies to support remote working -- if only in pockets across the business -- I think the adoption of these will increase significantly, and will likely remain consistent going forward,.
24440 24440 If the infection rate does not come down quickly ... because we are so integrated with China, we are going to feel the effects here.
24441 24441 For me, that 's a much more important issue worth thinking about. Can the government use its balance sheet or create an environment where the private sector wants to use its balance sheet to undertake investments the country needs ?.
24448 24448 It would be wrong to communicate a message that we will not be prepared or ready for this,.
24451 24451 We would seek information on what carriage ( of a train ) were they sitting on, had they a booked seat, that sort of thing.
24454 24454 If the US can go after a high level military enemy from the air with drones and kill him, it means that the US can go after any of their political and military enemies in the same way. At some point it could be Putin 's turn.
24464 24464 My view is we need to clear this up - was there a conspiracy or was n't there a conspiracy, and if there was, who was involved and was it criminal ?.
24468 24468 In the first stage, people will go back to the factory or the office. Then I suspect there 'll be a lot of business for barbershops and beauty salons once they reopen, and for retail that does n't involve large numbers of people in a crowded space. Only when people feel safer -- and the government relaxes guidance -- will restaurants, movie theaters, concerts and sporting events resume.
24469 24469 If things work out well, banks can distribute income later on,.
24470 24470 And it has put central banks in a position where they do n't have a lot of ammunition. If we have a serious recession, we 're probably not going to be able to count on central banks to offer up a significant response.
24471 24471 The continent can learn a lot from what you are doing in the ICT sector but you also have challenges with climate change and its consequences,.
24473 24473 The discussed operation would also not lead to any changes in the deficit. It is a pure balance sheet operation moving debt from some parts of the government, the cities, to the central government,.
24474 24474 This would follow if the pandemic and containment measures last longer, emerging and developing economies are even more severely hit, tight financial conditions persist, or if widespread scarring effects emerge due to firm closures and extended unemployment.
24475 24475 Monetary policy has continued to support growth and buoyant financial conditions. With these developments, there are now tentative signs that global growth may be stabilizing, though at subdued levels.
24477 24477 In the case of South Africa, the problem is still at the level of policy uncertainty tied to the slow pace of structural reforms that has been weighing on growth. And because now there is limited fiscal space, public spending is now weaker than it could have been, and these factors are having an impact.
24480 24480 As long as interest rates remain very low, as we 're seeing, and we get the recovery that we are projecting, then the combination should help in bringing down debt levels slowly over time,.
24481 24481 I would also say the US tax system could be somewhat more progressive ... it 's not right for the times,.
24491 24491 I would emphasize the direction is clear, though the orders of magnitude are still to be determined,.
24492 24492 There are downside risks from global growth and the possibility that uncertainties over future trading relationships could remain entrenched,.
24494 24494 In the context of relatively weak earnings growth, there 's probably too much complacency and we could see some negative earnings,.
24497 24497 but think that central bankers will still want to do their part to support the economy, especially at a time when few of them worry about inflation rising too much. This implies that if the news on the virus and the economy remains negative in the near term, central banks may well react aggressively even if the impact on economic growth is limited.
24498 24498 The committee has noted previously that even a contraction of just a few months can meet its recession definition if it is sufficiently deep,.
24499 24499 Maybe even more important, or at least as important.
24503 24503 Interest rates are very low right now. Inflation is nowhere. We actually can spend as much money as we need to to get us through this.
24517 24517 There 's no point putting in a tail hedge. It 's just like hedging currency if you have a long-term view. It just creates a cost with no expected benefit other than smoothing. And what would you hedge against ? You do n't know what will show up.
24518 24518 We need corporations alive .... We absolutely need to bail out small business owners. No small business owner should have been setting aside savings for this. They should have a rainy day fund, not a Noah 's flood fund.
24520 24520 I 'd probably start with making election day a holiday before I jumped straight to mobile voting,.
24522 24522 I think that 's an extremely important discussion and I agree with your assessment : I think we 're compelled to think about that.
24529 24529 We may also choose to reestablish similar or different forms of hedges or raise more cash based on developments with the coronavirus and other market factors. In other words, we are more likely to have higher portfolio turnover in this environment.
24535 24535 I think this is a challenging situation, but it has to be part of the process of the Northern Ireland economy being transformed to one where there are higher skills, higher wages and higher productivity.
24542 24542 I intend to retire as solo artist after album no3 as I have just had a call from my brother begging me to start oasis again in 2022 if you believe in life after love c 'm on you know LG x.
24543 24543 How do you think Noel is passing the time while on lockdown ?.
24546 24546 I intend to retire as [ a ] solo artist after album no3 as I have just had a call from my brother begging me to start oasis again in 2022 if you believe in life after love c 'm on you know LG x.
24548 24548 A big part of these emissions could be brought down quite fast and easily,.
24551 24551 We said the golden age of gas can be materialized through LNG, and it is what we are seeing today,.
24553 24553 In some major producing economies, it will be almost impossible to finance essential areas such as health, public sector employment and education -- and we may well see social pressures that challenge the stability of countries such as Iraq, Angola and Nigeria.
24554 24554 The second ( reason ) ... I think the world needs a global political response,.
24555 24555 put clean energy at the heart of stimulus plans to counter the coronavirus crisis .... The progress this will achieve in transforming countries' energy infrastructure wo n't be temporary -- it can make a lasting difference to our future.
24556 24556 The most important thing to recognize is that fiscal and monetary policy -- a quick tax cut or jolt of infrastructure spending and Fed interest rate cuts and bond purchases -- will be akin to passing out candles,.
24558 24558 Anything 's possible right now, I do n't believe that 's likely.
24559 24559 This entails an alliance that has a tangible plan with capable leaders to implement. Whether it is me or someone else, the job must be done. I will be a happy man. It is not about positions but knowing what to do.
24561 24561 The next technical resistance area is the $ 1700 to $ 1800 area so any move above $ 1566 is likely to be a fast, strong one, perhaps with a retest of the $ 1566 area from above that.
24562 24562 We 've always had a plan in place to protect our employees because we knew there could be some event someday,.
24564 24564 They can shut down for a month, but then when they reopen, they 're still going to have an epidemic starting again,.
24566 24566 But I ca n't ever see myself putting down my beloved tools -- I 'll probably die at my bench !.
24567 24567 Whether it 's Cadbury, Ritz, Oreo, or one of its many other brands, Mondelēz 's products are renowned around the world,.
24570 24570 How long can society take these measures like social distancing ? What is their saturation level ? This is an uncertain thing. It is not a conventional economic crisis. It 's a shock in which both demand and supply are affected,.
24572 24572 I think the public health issue is the most important one,.
24573 24573 Look, if it were n't the case, that the central bank could create inflation and the central bank could buy up the entire planet Earth,.
24574 24574 more like a major snowstorm or natural disaster than a Great Depression-style downturn.
24575 24575 I think we still have time. The clock 's ticking, though.
24576 24576 You could have zero waste, but that would probably mean you 're sending the money out so slowly ... that it does n't serve the recovery purpose,.
24584 24584 They knew guys like me would buy the company and throw them out.
24587 24587 cosmic justice must be hand-made by holders of power who impose their own decision on how these flesh-and-blood individuals should be categorized into abstraction, and how these abstractions should then be forcibly configured to fit the vision of the power-holders.
24593 24593 There should also be a commitment to respect EU surveillance frameworks ... it would be no more than that,.
24599 24599 able to tap the best opinion around here or overseas to marshal a strategy for this country moving forward over the next several decades.
24604 24604 it raises the possibility that negative effects on consumer and business sentiment and a pullback in investor risk-taking could last after the spread of the coronavirus has stabilized.
24607 24607 Millennial investors should commence investing in large-cap or index funds and then diversify to multi-cap or mid-cap funds as per their risk appetite.
24612 24612 As such, the outbreak should not directly affect the longer-term viability and productive potential of most businesses or of the economy as a whole.
24618 24618 for embracing important reforms that can do much to encourage sustainable poverty reduction.
24619 24619 And so we have a very real problem of the IFIs themselves adding to the debt burden and, and there 's pressure then I think on the IMF to sort through it and look at the best interest for the country,.
24620 24620 From the White House, you can move a lot faster,.
24622 24622 Youth unemployment must be given top priority. With 12-million graduates entering the labour market each year and only 3-million of them getting jobs, the mountain of youth unemployment is rising annually,.
24623 24623 in the almost inconceivable event that a President Sanders were able to enact his full economic agenda, the result would surely be much worse than anything that 's likely to happen under Trump.
24630 24630 It 's not possible or feasible.
24631 24631 I would very much be in favor of a nationwide carbon price,.
24632 24632 Many of our restaurants are closed, and servers are out of work. These food distributions can really make a difference,.
24639 24639 I think Israel is the best-kept secret when it comes to music, and not a lot of Israeli artists have broken into the international sphere, so there 's a lot of passion there that is not fulfilled yet,.
24641 24641 The continuation of the recent trend could lead to the point where the poor ... would be unable to protect themselves against coronavirus ... they would become the epicentre of contracting and spreading the disease.
24643 24643 The U.S. economy mainly consists of small businesses ... and this is a challenge in a situation where policymakers want to quickly get money into the hands of the corporate sector either via fiscal policy or monetary policy.
24649 24649 All we have to do is find a window and we can easily afford to bring 16 players for two days on a weekend and finish the tournament on a high note.
24658 24658 There is one very large difference between virus economics and regular business cycle economics, which is with virus economics the most important thing you can do for the economy is slow the spread of the virus .... The best [ thing ] to do [ after that ] would be to start by having the federal government entice states to cut their sales taxes. At a moment of fear the large amount of money you are sending to people as an income tax cut, they are n't going to spend.
24661 24661 The coming impact is going to be huge. This is no longer a question of if, but when. Even if this ( Covid-19 ) does n't turn out to be the deadliest flu, the economic impact is going to big. We may be fast moving towards a point where there are no flights operating anywhere in the world.
24667 24667 This could profoundly transform the psycho-oncologic care of patients with cancer, and importantly could be used in hospice settings to help terminally ill cancer patients approach death with improved emotional and spiritual well-being,.
24672 24672 If you go back to the beginning of the millennium, there 's been no progress since then,.
24676 24676 Uncertainty remains elevated, of course, but the Phase One China-U.S. trade deal and the pending ratification of CUSMA are positive developments that should lead to lower business uncertainty over time everywhere, including in Canada.
24677 24677 Coronavirus is precisely coming from emerging countries in Asia, not mobilising the G20 seems to me a very big anomaly.
24678 24678 help avoid another national lockdown or reduce the need for multiple localised lockdowns later,.
24679 24679 I think economics is incredibly eclectic.
24680 24680 I used to believe that only catastrophes manifestly caused by climate change would break through the psychological walls of denial,.
24686 24686 Government hospitals will run out of beds in rural India even if only 0.03 per cent of the rural population is hit by the virus,.
24690 24690 My very good friend and brother Tony Elumelu continues to make Nigeria proud. His example of making strategic investments in infrastructure, that creates public good, is one we should all applaud. It is an honour to be here this afternoon to see yet again, an underperforming asset turned into what we are witnessing here,.
24696 24696 The CBK may need to do some heavy lifting in terms of supporting economic growth now that fiscal consolidation is a theme going into 2020,.
24699 24699 Output will inevitably shrink because most workers can no longer do their jobs,.
24700 24700 I believe the great majority of scientists will say the same, these measures are certainly appropriate and sensible and it was high time that they are taken by the government. Whether they are effective will depend on compliance and the PM message needs to be reinforced by a daily communication exercise targeting the general public as well as special groups like young people.
24706 24706 We welcome Trump in our country. I do n't think there is going to be any trade deal per se as has been talked about in the past.
24707 24707 We are going to take a hit. It might not be a full out recession, but we 're moving closer to that,.
24708 24708 We would have been able to see that this was n't just a local thing, it 's spreading.
24710 24710 A company such as TIM, which competes on the market, can not wait for too long. A solution must be found rapidly,.
24713 24713 I wish so much that the world could see the Mark I know,.
24715 24715 This is not going to business as usual, and the marketing industry is certainly going to see a real impact. I do n't think anyone knows how big. So we 're going to watch and look.
24718 24718 75 % or so of new infectious diseases are zoonotic in nature.
24720 24720 the virus could improve prospects for some aspects of social safety nets, such as in health care,.
24723 24723 Mga kapwa ko kinatawan sa Kongreso, kailangan may gawin po tayo. ` Wag nating payagang maging laganap ang patayan sa ating bayan, kahit anupamang dahilan,.
24728 24728 You would have to start from scratch to include political leave and be sure to recognize Indigenous government as part of that while building the legislation,.
24729 24729 The employer will get some benefits in terms of increased productivity, morale and retention. But I do n't think many will think that is a profit-enhancing shift,.
24731 24731 The dramatic escalation in electoral promises -- as yet uncosted -- risks running a deficit, adding to the national debt, overheating the economy further, and running up against our fiscal rules. Worse, it probably fuels increased cynicism amongst the electorate, because there is little to no chance of all the promises being met,.
24732 24732 The way to think about it is that, you know, businesses are going to have to pay wages for people even though there are n't a lot of sales because everybody is staying home,.
24733 24733 You do n't know anything, but nobody else knows anything either. But together, other people know a lot more than you do. And so if you see other people confidently taking some action, that 's at the very least a reason to investigate why it might make sense for you to do so too.
24734 24734 Acute concerns and uncertainty gripped market participants, as the expectation of a rapid V-shaped recovery now appeared grossly unrealistic,.
24741 24741 They might think it sensible to bring in a few independents to make it more comfortable,.
24745 24745 It is then important that the banks continue to provide these companies with loans so that the credit supply is not threatened. The measures taken in this situation should be regarded as a form of insurance that enables Swedish companies - -- particularly small and medium-sized enterprises -- to feel secure that the credit supply will not fail.
24750 24750 But before it gets worse, we have time for the supply chains to adapt. North America, when it comes to food, is very much self-sufficient. So if America is affected, that 's when it will greatly impact us in Canada.
24752 24752 But one can confidently say that things have improved significantly.
24755 24755 Realizing that there are a lot of people here that you can reach by Facebook and email, but there are some that you ca n't. We do n't know everyone in the community here.
24758 24758 Both esports and Call of Duty are deeply rooted in our core DNA so we are delighted that the day has finally come for Call of Duty League to launch. We could n't be prouder or more excited to be a foundational partner and to continue innovating the way gamers use a controller to help them perform at the highest level,.
24760 24760 I know of no example where we 've taken this type of a step. I might say, up until ten years ago I do n't think it would have been possible to think about alternative delivery methods because we did n't have the technology available,.
24764 24764 There is also a tension about the Chinese role in supplying medical aid where historically the US would have played that role. There are also lower-order conflicts, [ including ] over the oil price between Russia and the Saudis.
24765 24765 We estimate that losses of trade in goods and services could amount to $ 320 billion per quarter of business disruption. Each quarter of Covid-19 related trade losses in 2020 is thus comparable to the annual impact of the U.S.-China trade dispute on world tariffs in 2019,.
24767 24767 If you had told me on Day 1 of filming he was going to win, I would have choked on my coffee,.
24769 24769 Unlike in the 2008 financial crisis, banks are not the source of the problem this time. But we need to ensure that they can be part of the solution.
24771 24771 A widely used, state-backed Chinese digital currency could certainly have an impact, especially in areas where China 's interests do not coincide with those of the west,.
24775 24775 Sanders ... may still have the very belated chance to lead the historic paradigm shift, even if he does n't get the nomination.
24779 24779 Every time we bring a child or an adult in a wheelchair on the float, I get emotional.
24781 24781 My fear is that enough will be done to keep countries like Italy solvent, but not enough will be done to change their political trajectory. Similarly to what happened in the way Europe rectified its initial missteps on sending medical help to Italy, the same might happen economically but you may have aid to Italy but that is too late and that results in a strengthening of eurosceptic forces.
24784 24784 The key measures in the coming weeks will be social distancing, self-isolation, quarantine, shelter in place, and other measures to shut down, deliberately and systematically -- if well done -- key parts of social and economic life,.
24787 24787 We ca n't let it go until 2021. I would rather rip the Band-Aid off.
24791 24791 This might not be the end of my time with Bjorn,.
24799 24799 Unwillingness to clean up has prolonged state of malaise in Indian economy ... Clean up has to be undertaken on an emergency basis, otherwise sense of confidence which is needed in our NBFC, private banks and even in our state-owned banks that would be missing, that means financial sector can not contribute to the growth,.

24804 24804 It seems that a recession is inevitable. However, its depth and duration are still unknown.
24805 24805 The nature of our mine development projects is such that certain work can not be done remotely, so our focus is on reducing the risk of the virus spreading to our projects. Operational continuity is critical for jobs, the communities around our operations, and the local economies. We will continue to adapt our response as this situation evolves, with our primary focus being the health and safety of our people,.
24822 24822 I am not today concerned about the inverted yield curve because I think it 's not really reflecting the U.S. outlook.
24826 24826 The police thought it was pretty unusual -- the thing about paintings is that they are one-offs, so you ca n't really resell it,.
24827 24827 There is no more feared or revered person today in the world of finance,.
24828 24828 Things are going to be softer than we thought,.
24832 24832 Mortgage holders who are n't paying a competitive rate could be paying a lazy tax bill to the tune of $ 200,000 so switching to a better loan is a no-brainer.
24837 24837 with these numbers we seriously can never deliver on the global Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and Africa 's 50-year development Agenda 2063, the Africa We Want. We know that and our leaders know that too.
24838 24838 For a strategy on silencing the guns to be successful, we must honestly seek to build more inclusive societies and this union has an important yet untapped role to play in this quest,.
24839 24839 Africa may lose half of its GDP ( gross domestic product ), with growth falling from 3.2 percent to about 2 percent due to a number of reasons, which include the disruption of global supply chains,.
24845 24845 To live in poverty may be sad, but to ` offend or [ be ] hurtful to society', creating problems for those who are not poor', is, it would appear the real tragedy. It is n't easy to push much further the reduction of human beings into ` means'.
24848 24848 might become much larger if the coronavirus outbreak spreads quickly and slows down activity in other countries, disrupting supply chains further,.
24849 24849 But in some economies -- most importantly the U.S. -- they are largely or entirely offset by the negative effects on the oil-producing sector.
24854 24854 We are going to discuss how the world economy can be more oriented towards the needs of everyone, how it can serve the aspirations of all people and it ( the Vatican ) is a good place to have that discussion,.
24855 24855 a recession [ this year ] at least as bad as during the global financial crisis or worse.
24856 24856 During the global financial crisis, for example, fiscal stimulus by the G-20 amounted to about 2 per cent of GDP, or over US $ 900 billion in today 's money, in 2009 alone. So, there is a lot more work to do.
24857 24857 At the top of the income distribution, our research shows that marginal tax rates can be raised without sacrificing economic growth.
24863 24863 We now guesstimate that second quarter GDP will drop at a 10 % annualized rate, after a 2 % fall in Q1. We look for a 6 % rebound in the third quarter and 4 % on the fourth, but that wo n't recover all the lost ground and we think GDP will fall by about 1 % across the year as a whole. Congress needs now to step up, in real size.
24864 24864 The proportion of positive tests continues to rise [ in the US ]. Yesterday, 18.3 % of test results were positive, up from 15.0 % a week ago ; wider testing is uncovering more cases. If testing numbers increase from the current c100K per day, the rate of growth of cases could rise ; the downtrend ... is not certain to continue,.
24865 24865 Payrolls rarely drop as much as claims rise, because claims tell us nothing about gross hirings, and often people who lose a job and make a claim then quickly find a new position. This time, though, we expect most of the people who have made claims to hit the payroll number, because even the regular pace of gross hiring -- which is n't happening right now - would be trivial compared the scale of the losses,.
24870 24870 The world is facing a medical emergency that monetary and fiscal policy can not fix,.
24871 24871 We have been buying back our stock. We think it 's an incredible deal. It 's basically gone on clearance sale in the past few days and we think it 's an enormous, it 's a fantastic investment and it reduces the number of outstanding shares or otherwise known as partners we have to share our very good profits with.
24873 24873 We have to look at everything because we 're not winning so if you 're not winning, you have to assess everything. I think anybody would want to do that and probably in the next month or so, we 're going to get together as an organization and just discuss things.
24877 24877 Additional work will need to be undertaken in order to test the conceptual study 's findings, but the initial results indicate that Toral should have limited impact on the local water conditions and that it does not suffer from any significant water issues that could impact on the future economic development of the project.
24879 24879 Because things are calming down in certain places [ and ] in the schools which we believe can already be reopened, classes can be resumed starting February 3,.

24883 24883 How could a university that 's supposedly educating tomorrow 's citizens and leaders actually invest in and finance the fossil fuel industry and global warming ?.
24885 24885 If evidence builds that the weakness in activity could persist, risk management considerations would favor a relatively prompt response,.
24888 24888 Today is all about action, the actions that the private sector can take to support a whole economy transition, the actions that regulators, governments and countries can take that will catalyse and amplify your actions, the actions that people are demanding and that future generations deserve.

24910 24910 It cuts off the abuse that has been identified with the subsidy. The second point is we want some kind of voucher system or cash transfer system that will just do that, which is targeted at the beneficiary.
24911 24911 The financial industry must play the role of opening the sluice so the accumulated resources can be used to enhance our growth engine,.
24913 24913 The Uttarakhand Government has got a new law passed by the Assembly. On the face of it, one can say that it is unconstitutional. Many sadhus came to see me to ask me to file a PIL. Will consider.
24914 24914 The court is left with a distinct impression ... that this is perhaps a textbook example of a ` political interest litigation' dressed up as a PIL.
24920 24920 We can see everything bought everywhere.
24921 24921 It is very likely this year the global economy will experience its worst recession since the Great Depression, surpassing that seen during the global financial crisis a decade ago. ` The Great Lockdown', as one might call it, is projected to shrink global growth dramatically.
24925 24925 There are so many outfits like these in different states ... they should be targeted the same way we target the RSS,.
24927 24927 The good news appears to be that there is recognition that what matters is human outcomes and climate outcomes, not budgetary outcomes,.
24930 24930 This idea we 're going to restart everything soon enough in a week or so is totally nuts,.
24931 24931 We just think it 's too early to put risk on, given some of the significant risks that are both with the progression of the disease and the negative effects of financial conditions tightening and the policy response is not quite being there yet,.

24934 24934 And we should not worry about a fiscal deficit target being higher than what has been announced. Because this is much more important. You know if there is security matter or something then you spend money more,.

24961 24961 Our [ overseas ] players are ready to return anytime. They are keen to finish on a high and if there is a possibility of rescheduling the PSL, we support it. There are commercial elements involved as well, so those remaining three games are very important.
